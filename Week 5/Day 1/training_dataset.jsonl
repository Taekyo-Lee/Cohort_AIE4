The risk of such biased results and discriminatory effects is particularly relevant with regard to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities.

AI systems used for those purposes may lead to discrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, such as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or sexual orientation, or may create new forms of discriminatory impacts.
