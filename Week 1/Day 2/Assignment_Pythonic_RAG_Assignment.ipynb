              " '1 Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:  \\nWe are living through a period of historic economic, societal, and geopolitical change. The world in 2022 looks nothing like \\nthe world in 2019. As I write this, inflation is at a 40 -year high, supply chains are stretched, and the war in Ukraine is \\nongoing. At the same time, we are entering a technological era with the potential to power awesome advancements \\nacross every sector of our economy and society. As the world’s largest software company, this places us at a historic \\nintersection of opportunity and responsibility to the world around us.  \\nOur mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more has never been more \\nurgent or more necessary. For all the uncertainty in the world, one thing is clear: People and organizations in every \\nindustry are increasingly looking to digital technology to overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. And no \\ncompany is better positioned to help them than Microsoft.  \\nEvery day this past fiscal year I have had the privilege to witness our customers use our platforms and tools to connect \\nwhat technology can do with what the world needs  it to do.  \\nHere are just a few examples:  \\n• Ferrovial, which builds and manages some of the world’s busiest airports and highways, is using our cloud \\ninfrastructure to build safer roads as it prepares for a future of autonomous transportation.  \\n• Peace Parks Foundation, a nonprofit helping protect natural ecosystems in Southern Africa, is using Microsoft \\nDynamics 365 and Power BI to secure essential funding, as well as our Azure AI and IoT solutions to help \\nrangers scale their park maintenance and wildlife crime prevention work.  \\n• One of the world’s largest robotics companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, is using the breadth of our tools —\\nfrom Azure IoT and HoloLens —to create an industrial metaverse solution that brings its distributed workforce \\ntogether with its network of connected equipment to improve productivity and keep employees safe.  \\n• Globo, the biggest media and TV company in Brazil, is using Power Platform to empower its employees to \\nbuild their own solutions for everything from booking sets to setting schedules.  \\n• And Ørsted, which produces a quarter of the world’s wind energy, is using the Microsoft Intelligent Data \\nPlatform to turn data from its offshore turbines into insights for predictive maintenance.  \\nAmid this dynamic environment, we delivered record results in fiscal year 2022: We reported $198  billion in revenue and \\n$83 billion in operating income. And the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $100  billion in annualized revenue for the first time.  \\nOUR RESPONSIBILITY  \\nAs a corporation, our purpose and actions must be aligned with addressing the world’s problems, not creating new ones. \\nAt our very core, we need to deliver innovation that helps drive broad economic growth. We, as a company, will do well \\nwhen the world around us does well.  \\nThat’s what I believe will lead to widespread human progress and ultimately improve the lives of everyone. There is no \\nmore powerful input than digital technology to drive the world’s economic output. This is the core thesis for our being as a \\ncompany, but it’s not enough. As we drive global economic growth, we must also commit to creating a more inclusive, \\nequitable, sustainable, and trusted future.  \\nSupport inclusive economic growth  \\nWe must ensure the growth we drive reaches every person, organization, community, and country. This starts with \\nincreasing access to digital skills. This year alone, more than 23  million people accessed digital skills training as part of \\nour global skills initiative.  ',\n",
              " '2   \\nBut skills alone aren’t enough —we need to help people better prepare for and connect to jobs. That’s why we’ve \\ncommitted to equip 10  million people from underserved communities with skills for jobs in the digital economy by 2025.  \\nOne area of digital skills has become especially critical: cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a significant threat for \\ngovernments, businesses, and individuals around the world, yet there simply aren’t enough people with cybersecurity \\nskills to fill open jobs.  \\nTo help address this, we’ve committed to skill and recruit 250,000 people into the US cybersecurity workforce by 2025 —\\nespecially those underrepresented in the field. And we’re helping an additional 24 countries with substantial cybersecurity \\nworkforce shortages close their gaps too.  \\nWe also continue to deliver affordable, relevant cloud technology and industry -specific solutions to nonprofit organizations \\naddressing the world’s most pressing issues. This year, we provided $3.2  billion in donated and discounted technology to \\n302,000 nonprofits serving over 1.2  billion people globally. And earlier this month, we announced that Microsoft will \\ndouble the number of nonprofits we reach worldwide over the next five years.  \\nProtect fundamental rights  \\nWe unequivocally support the fundamental rights of people, from defending democracy, to protecting human rights, to \\naddressing racial injustice and inequity. And, as people’s access to education, healthcare, jobs, and other critical services  \\nbecomes increasingly dependent on technology, it’s clear that access to broadband and accessible technology is also \\nfundamental to building a more equitable future.  \\nSince 2017, we’ve helped more than 50  million people in unserved rural communities globally gain access to affordable \\nbroadband coverage. Building on our work in eight US cities, we’re now partnering with five US states with significant \\nbroadband adoption gaps to increase access, adoption, and equity. And —given the importance of current data to \\nbroadband planning —the new Microsoft Digital Equity Dashboard will help US policymakers and communities identify \\nneighborhoods where funding and programmatic investment can achieve measurable impact.  \\nThis year, we continued our journey to address racial injustice and inequity by increasing representation within Microsoft, \\nengaging our ecosystem, and strengthening our communities.  \\nAcross our ecosystem, we are more than 90%  of the way toward our commitment to spend an incremental $500  million \\nwith Black - and African American -owned suppliers. We’ve coordinated over 80 justice reform partnerships to help 145 \\ncommunities expand access to data -driven insights that advance a more equitable system of justice and public safety. \\nAnd we’ve expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support (TEALS) program to 290  high schools in cities with \\nlarge Black and African American communities —to promote more equitable access to computer science education.  \\nOur work to help preserve, protect, and advance democracy by promoting a healthy information ecosystem and \\nsafeguarding electoral processes is as salient as ever in today’s geopolitical climate. Our AccountGuard nation -state \\nthreat notification service protects more than 4  million accounts of election officials, human rights organizations, \\njournalists, and other organizations. Our efforts to preserve and protect journalism in the United States and Mexico have \\nbeen extended globally through new partnerships with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Report for the World, and \\nothers.  \\nThis year, we responded to six humanitarian emergencies in five countries through donations, technology, services, and \\nemployee giving. As of July 2022, we’ve committed $257  million in financial and technology assistance to the global \\nresponse to the war in Ukraine, including support for government, businesses, nonprofits, and humanitarian assistance for \\nrefugees. And, through our AI for Humanitarian Action initiative, we’re helping organizations harness the power of AI to \\nimprove their disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.  \\nFinally, we continued working toward our five -year commitment to bridge the disability divide for the more than 1  billion \\npeople around the world with disabilities, seeking to expand accessibility in technology, the workforce, and  ',\n",
              " '3 workplace. As just one example of this work, use of our Office Accessibility Checker —our “spell check” for accessibility —\\nhas grown by 9x over the past year. And, along with partner companies, we launched the Neurodiversity Career \\nConnector, a jobs marketplace for neurodivergent job seekers.  \\nCreate a sustainable future  \\nWe must ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of our planet. Addressing climate change requires \\nswift, collective action and technical innovation. We’re continuing our pursuit of our own ambitious commitments and \\nhelping others achieve their climate goals, aided by technology.  \\nIn March, we released our second annual sustainability report, sharing our progress, challenges, and learnings as we \\npursue our commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste. Although we continued to make \\nprogress on several of our goals with an overall reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions \\nincreased, due in large part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage. Despite \\nthese increases, we remain dedicated to achieving a net -zero future. We recognize that progress won’t always be linear, \\nand the rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time.  \\nOn the path to becoming water positive, we invested in 21 water replenishment projects that are expected to generate \\nover 1.3  million cubic meters of volumetric benefits in nine water basins around the world. Progress toward our zero waste \\ncommitment included diverting more than 15,200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators, \\nas well as launching new Circular Centers to increase reuse and reduce e -waste at our datacenters.  \\nWe contracted to protect over 17,000 acres of land (50% more than the land we use to operate), thus achieving our \\ncommitment to protect more land than we use by 2025.  \\nAnd with Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, we’re expanding our work to help customers meet their ambitious \\nsustainability goals by enabling them to better collect, track, and analyze the metrics of their sustainability strategy.  \\nEarn trust  \\nTo drive positive impact and growth with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the \\ncompanies behind them. We are committed to earning trust —both trust in business model alignment with our customers \\nand partners, and trust in technology, spanning privacy, security, digital safety, the responsible use of AI, and \\ntransparency.  \\nWe’re dedicated to preserving our customers’ privacy and their ability to control their own data. We advocate for strong \\nprivacy laws that require companies, including ours, to be accountable and responsible in their collection and use of \\npersonal data. That’s why we supported the new Trans -Atlantic Data Privacy Framework and committed to meet or \\nexceed all the requirements it outlines. And through the Microsoft privacy dashboard, millions of people each year can \\nmake meaningful choices about how their data is used.  \\nSecurity and digital safety are foundational to trust in today’s complex threat landscape. We analyze 43 trillion security \\nsignals daily and use the insights to inform increased protections. This year, we blocked 34.7  billion identity threats and \\n37 billion email threats. Over the past four years, we’ve sent over 67,000 nation -state -related threat notifications to \\ncustomers to help them protect themselves from digital threats.  \\nThis comprehensive capability has been critical during recent world events, including the war in Ukraine. Our efforts have \\ninvolved both defending key infrastructure in the country —including assisting with the detection and disruption of \\ncyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and evacuating data to the cloud —as well as supporting people, \\ncommunities, and organizations on the ground as part of our humanitarian and disaster response.  ',\n",
              " '4   \\nOur commitment to responsibly develop and use technologies like AI is core to who we are. We put our commitment into \\npractice, not only within Microsoft but by empowering our customers and partners to do the same and by advocating for \\npolicy change. We released our Responsible AI Standard, which outlines 17 goals aligned to our six AI principles and \\nincludes tools and practices to support them. And we share our open -source tools, including the new Responsible AI \\nDashboard, to help developers building AI technologies identify and mitigate issues before deployment.  \\nFinally, we provide clear reporting and information on how we run our business and how we work with customers and \\npartners, delivering the transparency that is central to trust. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress \\nand learnings across these four commitments, and our Reports Hub  provides detailed reports on our environmental data, \\nour political activities,  our workforce demographics, our human rights work, and more.  \\nWe should all be proud of this work —and I am. But it’s easy to talk about what we’re doing well. As we look to the next \\nyear and beyond, we’ll continue to reflect on where the world needs us to do better.  \\nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \\nNow, let me turn to how we are positioned to capture the massive opportunities ahead. Over the past few years, I’ve \\nwritten extensively about digital transformation, but now we need to go beyond that to deliver on what I call the “digital \\nimperative.”  \\nTechnology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Every organization in every industry will need to infuse \\ntechnology into every business process and function so they can do more with less. It’s what I believe will make the \\ndifference between organizations that thrive and those that get left behind.  \\nIn the coming years, technology as a percentage of GDP will double from 5% to 10% and beyond, as technology moves \\nfrom a back -office cost center to a defining feature of every product and service. But even more important will be \\ntechnology’s influence on the other 90% of the world’s economy. From communications and commerce, to logistics, \\nfinancial services, energy, healthcare, and entertainment, digital technology will power the entire global economy as every \\ncompany becomes a software company in its own right.  \\nAcross our customer solution areas, we are delivering powerful platforms, tools, and services that expand our opportunity \\nto help every organization in every industry deliver on the digital imperative —with a business model that is trusted and \\nalways aligned with their success.  \\nApps and infrastructure  \\nWe are building Azure as the world’s computer, with more than 60 datacenter regions —more than any other provider —\\ndelivering faster access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements. With Azure Arc, we’re \\nbringing Azure anywhere, meeting customers where they are and enabling them to run apps across on -premises, edge, or \\nmulticloud environments. And we’re extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge with Azure for Operators, \\nintroducing new solutions to help telecom operators deliver ultra -low-latency services closer to end users.  \\nAs the digital and physical worlds come together, we’re also leading in the industrial metaverse. From smart factories, to \\nsmart buildings, to smart cities, we’re helping organizations use Azure IoT, Azure Digital Twins, and Microsoft Mesh to \\ndigitize people, places, and things, in order to visualize, simulate, and analyze any business process.  \\nData and AI  \\nFrom best -in-class databases and analytics to data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help \\nevery organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. With our new Microsoft Intelligent Data  ',\n",
              " '5 Platform, we are helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating a fragmented data estate. Cosmos DB \\nis the go -to database powering the world’s most demanding, mission -critical workloads, at any scale. With Azure \\nSynapse, we’re removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics so anyone can \\ncollaborate, build, and manage analytics solutions. And we’re creating an entirely new market category with Microsoft \\nPurview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds.  \\nWhen it comes to AI, we’re seeing a paradigm shift as the world’s large AI models become platforms themselves. And we \\nare helping organizations apply the world’s most advanced coding and language models to a variety of use cases, such \\nas writing assistance, code generation, and reasoning over data with our new Azure OpenAI Service.  \\nDigital and app innovation  \\nWe have the most popular developer tools for any cloud and any platform to help organizations modernize existing apps \\nand build new ones. GitHub is the most complete developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. This \\nyear, we introduced GitHub Copilot, a first -of-its-kind AI pair programmer, to help developers write better code faster. And \\norganizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our Azure PaaS services to streamline development and \\ncreate modern, more resilient cloud -native applications.  \\nLow-code/no -code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization’s digital capability. With Power Platform, we \\nare helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains when it’s never been more important. We have nearly \\n25 million monthly active users. And we’re innovating to make it even easier for teams of professional and citizen \\ndevelopers to automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data.  \\nBusiness applications  \\nWith our expanding portfolio of business applications, we are helping every business become a hyperconnected \\nbusiness —unifying data, process, and teams across the organization. New Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces helps \\norganizations across diverse industries —from real estate and retail, to factories and construction —manage their physical \\noperations. And with new integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams, we are creating a new category of \\ncollaborative applications that helps businesses surface data and insights right in the flow of work.  \\nOur industry clouds bring together capabilities across the Microsoft Cloud with industry -specific customizations to help \\norganizations improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We completed our acquisition of Nuance \\nCommunications this year, adding new cloud and enterprise AI capabilities for healthcare, as well as other industries. And \\nas sustainability becomes an existential priority not just for our society but for every organization, our new Microsoft Clou d \\nfor Sustainability, which I mentioned earlier, is helping our customers record, report, and ultimately reduce their \\nenvironmental impact.  \\nModern work  \\nHybrid work is now just work. Every organization is looking to reconnect and reengage the workforce at home, in the \\noffice, and everywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, surpassing \\n270 million monthly active users this year. It’s the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business \\nprocess automation in one place.  \\nTeams Rooms is bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help organizations rethink their approach to space \\nand help employees participate fully in meetings from anywhere. And with Microsoft Viva, we’re building an employee \\nexperience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights in the flow of work \\nto empower employees and strengthen their connection to their company’s mission and culture.

              " '6   \\nModern life  \\nThe PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play. This year, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to \\nour operating system in a decade. It reimagines everything from the user experience to the store to help people and \\norganizations be more productive, connected, and secure, and to build a more open ecosystem for developers and \\ncreators. There are now more than 1.4  billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11. We launched \\nnew Surface devices to support every person and work style. And we have nearly 60  million Microsoft 365  consumer \\nsubscriptions as we help people create, connect, and share wherever they go.  \\nSecurity  \\nCybersecurity is the number one threat facing every business today. To keep our customers secure, we build security by \\ndesign into every product we sell, and we deliver end -to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device \\nmanagement, and privacy across clouds and platforms. We are the only cloud provider with multicloud protection for the \\nindustry’s top three cloud platforms. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity \\ngovernance, and identity verification. And we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security \\nExperts.  \\nLinkedIn  \\nLinkedIn has become mission critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with jobs, learners with \\nskills, and marketers with buyers. LinkedIn now has more than 850  million members, and our Sales, Talent, Marketing, \\nand Premium Subscriptions lines of business have all surpassed $1  billion in annual revenue over the past 12 months.  \\nSearch, advertising, and news  \\nWhen it comes to advertising, we are creating a new monetization engine for the web —an alternative that offers \\nmarketers and publishers more long -term viable ad solutions —while upholding consumer privacy and strong data \\ngovernance. We’re focused on increasing our share and engagement across our browser Microsoft Edge, our search \\nengine Microsoft Bing, and our personalized content feed Microsoft Start.  \\nAnd with our acquisition of Xandr, we now power one of the largest marketplaces for premium advertising. Netflix chose \\nus this summer as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad -supported subscription offering, a validation of \\nthe differentiated value we provide to publishers looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them. I couldn’t be \\nmore excited about our expansive opportunity ahead in this space.  \\nGaming  \\nThe big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years continue to pay off. We’ve sold \\nmore Xbox Series S and Series X consoles life -to-date than any previous generation of Xbox, and with Xbox Cloud \\nGaming, we’re bringing games to entirely new endpoints. In the past year, we’ve made many of our most popular titles \\naccessible on phones, tablets, TVs, and low -spec PCs for the first time. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service now \\nincludes access to hundreds of games. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard, we aim to give players \\nmore choice to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want. Choice is equally important to developers, \\nwho we want to support with a diversity of distribution and business models for their games. We believe the acquisition \\nwill unlock opportunities for innovation and enable the industry to grow.  \\nOUR CULTURE  \\nOur culture is the foundation on which our mission and strategy stand, and cultivating it is our greatest priority.

Essential to this is our commitment to continually exercise our growth mindset and \\nconfront our fixed mindset with humility, curiosity, compassion, and the recognition that, while none of us will ever be \\nperfect, we can always be better than we are today.  \\nThis growth mindset served us well through the historic changes of the past few years. It sustains our everyday practice of \\ncustomer obsession. It helps us care for our colleagues and collaborate more effectively across the company. And it \\ndeeply informs our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion .  \\nIf we want to serve the world, we need to represent the world. Each year we strive to increase representation, and 2022 \\nwas no exception. We saw the strongest progress in years across several demographic groups, as you can see in our \\nlatest Diversity  & Inclusion Report. We are one of the most transparent companies of our size when it comes to the data \\nwe share, and we continually challenge ourselves to increase visibility into where we’re succeeding and where we need to \\naddress gaps. We’ve added new data, such as military status, gender representation by geography, employee exits, and \\nadditional pay data, to reflect our workforce more broadly. As we make meaningful pro gress, we continue our commitment \\nto meet the increasing expectations for driving innovation, welcoming diverse perspectives, and leading global change.  \\nGiving is also core to our culture at Microsoft. In 2022, our employees gave $255  million (with company match) to over \\n32,000 nonprofits. And more than 29,000 employees volunteered over 720,000 hours to causes they care about.  \\nI’m constantly in awe of how our employees bring their passion to work each day —for each other, for our customers, and \\nfor their communities.  \\n***  \\nI want to close by thanking you for your continued investment in Microsoft. Our growth and impact this past year would not \\nhave been possible without your commitment to the company and belief in its mission.  \\nThe opportunity to apply technology to make a real difference for every customer, community, and country has never \\nbeen greater. And I truly believe if we continue to live our mission, embrace our responsibility, and grasp that opportunity,  \\nthere is no limit to what we can achieve for the world in the year ahead and beyond.  \\n  \\n  \\n \\nSatya Nadella  \\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer  \\nOctober  24, 2022  ',\n",

              " '15   \\nCorporate Social Responsibility  \\nCommitment to Sustainability  \\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward \\na more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build \\nsustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold \\ncommitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon \\nwe have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1  billion over four years in new \\ntechnologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by \\n2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers \\nand customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.  \\nFiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our \\ngoals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due \\nin substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to \\ndeliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work \\nwill not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won’t always be linear.  \\nWhile fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that \\nilluminate the diversity of our work include:  \\n• We purchased the removal of 1.4  million metrics tons of carbon.  \\n• Four of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.  \\n• We granted $100  million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions \\nthe world needs to reach net -zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration \\nenergy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.  \\n• We joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal \\nsector, with a commitment of $200  million toward carbon removal by 2030.  \\nSustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft Cloud for  \\nSustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their \\noperations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call – an initiative to mobilize collective action \\nto solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future.  \\nThe investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, \\nfrom Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help \\nbusinesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.  \\nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity  \\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American \\ncommunities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees’ communities, and beyond. Our Racial \\nEquity Initiative focuses on three multi -year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by \\n2025.  \\n• Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black \\nand African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.  \\n• Evolving our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster \\nsocietal change and create new opportunities.

              " '16   \\n• Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: build on our momentum, adding a $150  million \\ninvestment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx \\nleaders in the United States by 2025.  \\nOver the last year, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale \\na number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice Reform \\nInitiative, expanding access to affordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key \\ninstitutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and \\nAfrican American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonprofits \\nthat provide critical services to Black and African American communities.  \\nWe have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. We are 90  percent of the way to our \\n2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, \\nand senior leaders in the U.S., and 50  percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual \\ncontributors, and senior leaders in the U.S.  \\nWe exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black - and African American -owned \\nfinancial institutions and increased our deposits with Black - and African American -owned minority depository institutions, \\nenabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, reaching more than \\n90 percent of our goal to spend $500  million with double the number of Black and African American -owned suppliers. We \\nalso increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative and continue to invest in the partner  \\ncommunity through the Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, \\nand mentorship.  \\nProgress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are \\ncommitted to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to hold \\nourselves accountable to accelerate change – for Microsoft, and beyond.  \\nInvesting in Digital Skills  \\nThe COVID -19 pandemic led to record unemployment, disrupting livelihoods of people around the world. After helping \\nover 30  million people in 249 countries and territories with our global skills initiative, we introduced a new initiative to \\nsupport a more skills -based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills \\nneeded for the most in -demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and \\njob-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic \\nGraph. We previously invested $20  million in key non -profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people \\nfrom underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy.  \\nWe also launched a national campaign with U.S. community colleges to help skill and recruit into the cybersecurity \\nworkforce 250,000 people by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making \\ncurriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s public community colleges, providing training for new and existing  \\nfaculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students.  \\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  \\nOverview  \\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world -changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and \\nour success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they \\ncan proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to \\nmaximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work \\nenvironment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every \\nperson and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  ',\n",
              " '17   \\nAs of June  30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full -time basis, 122,000 in the U.S. and 99,000 \\ninternationally. Of the total employed people, 85,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product \\nsupport, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and marketing; \\nand 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  \\nOur Culture  \\nMicrosoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. \\nWe believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre -determined, and we should always be learning and curious – trying \\nnew things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:  \\n• Obsessing over what matters to our customers.  \\n• Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.  \\n• Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.  \\n• Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us.  \\nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and \\nemployee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2022 Employee Signals \\nsurvey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and \\ndevelopment. Throughout the fiscal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal \\nyear 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the \\nCOVID -19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee \\nSignals and Daily Pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and \\ndevelopment, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support.  \\nDiversity and Inclusion  \\nAt Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to \\nachieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact \\neconomies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set \\nof circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we \\nrepresent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower.  \\nWe strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace \\nand workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance \\nto be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource \\nGroups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as \\nLGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community -building. As described in our 2021 Proxy \\nStatement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their \\ncontributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a \\nmultitude of workforce metrics including:  \\n• Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with \\ndata by job types, levels, and segments of our business.  \\n• Our EEO -1 report (equal employment opportunity).  \\n• Disability representation.  \\n• Pay equity (see details below).  ',\n",
              " '18   \\nTotal Rewards  \\nWe develop dynamic, sustainable, market -driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated \\nportfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture \\nand values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for \\nexample, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity \\nand career progress across multiple dimensions.  \\nAs part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to \\nall Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non -exempt and exempt employees and \\nequivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response \\nto the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award \\nopportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested in base salary adjustments for our \\ndatacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S. These investments have supported \\nretention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice.  \\nPay Equity  \\nIn our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined \\nearn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 \\nearned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our twelve other largest employee \\ngeographies representing 86.6% of our global population (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, \\nIsrael, Japan, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) combined earn $1.001 for every $1.000 by men in these \\ncountries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive \\ncompensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.  \\nWellness and Safety  \\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well -being and safety while they are at work and in their personal \\nlives.  \\nWe took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well -being of our employees, suppliers, and customers \\nduring the COVID -19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in shifting to return to office and/or hybrid \\narrangements. We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to \\nidentify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems.  \\nWe have invested significantly in holistic wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many \\nphysical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee \\nAssistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption \\nassistance, and back -up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure \\nemployees can stay safe while they are working.  \\nWe continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with emergency \\nrelocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits.  \\nLearning and Development  \\nOur growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing – seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, \\nembracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide range of \\nlearning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning \\nphilosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include:  \\n• Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning portal \\nLearning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS Learn are available to all \\nemployees worldwide.  ',\n",
              " '19   \\n• In-the-classroom learning, learning cohorts, our early -in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence \\ncommunities.  \\n• Required learning for all employees and managers on topics such as compliance, regulation, company \\nculture, leadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training.  \\n• On-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities.  \\n• Managers holding conversations about employees’ career and development plans, coaching on career \\nopportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship.  \\n• Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build \\nleadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs.  \\n• New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, and culture, as well as \\nongoing onboarding programs.  \\n• New tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the \\nnew flexible hybrid world of work. These include quick guides for teams to use, such as Creating Team \\nAgreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running Effective Hybrid Meetings.  \\nOur employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands \\nof informal and on -the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on -line learning solutions, in fiscal year 2022 our \\nemployees completed over 4.7  million courses, averaging over 14 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding \\ncore company beliefs and compliance topics, all employees complete required learning programs like Standards of \\nBusiness Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment courses. Our corporate learning portal has \\nover 100,000 average monthly active users. We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between \\n20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. \\nIn addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year.  \\nNew Ways of Working  \\nThe COVID -19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. We introduced a Hybrid \\nWorkplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift \\nparadigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value \\nthe flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun returning to worksites as \\nconditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of workweeks working at home, another \\nsite, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and \\nour business can deliver success.  \\nOPERATING SEGMENTS  \\nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business \\nProcesses, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive \\nfinancial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the \\ndevelopment, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational \\nallocation of resources within businesses.  \\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – \\nSegment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10 -K.  \\nOur reportable segments are described below.

Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit \\ntheir organizations, rather than managing on -premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by \\ninfrastructure -as-a-service and platform -as-a-service consumption -based services, and per user -based services such as \\nEnterprise Mobility + Security.  ',\n",
              " '22   \\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. \\nServer software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the \\nWindows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, \\nmanagement and operations, virtualization, service -oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also \\nlicense standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project \\nmanagers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is \\nmainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers \\n(“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and \\nWindows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.  \\nNuance and GitHub include both cloud and on -premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI \\nsolutions.

Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including \\nidentity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s competitive \\nadvantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a \\nsingle, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and \\ncomplexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allow s \\nus to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.  \\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by \\ncompanies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett -Packard, \\nIBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all \\ncomputer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating \\nsystem development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible \\napplications now produced by many commercial and non -commercial software developers. A number of companies, such \\nas Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.  \\nWe compete to provide enterprise -wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software \\nvendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and \\nintranet), security, hosting, database, and e -business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the \\nJava Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise -wide computing solutions.

This segment primarily comprises:  \\n• Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non -volume licensing of the \\nWindows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating \\nsystem, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows \\nInternet of Things.  \\n• Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.  \\n• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first - and third -party content \\n(including games and in -game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, \\nthird-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.  \\n• Search and news advertising.  \\nWindows  \\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling \\nconsistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted \\nsignificantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre -install on the \\ndevices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:  \\n• The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.  \\n• Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.  \\n• Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.  \\n• Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.  \\n• Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.  \\n• Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts \\nfrom local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows \\nversions licensed.  \\n• Constraints in the supply chain of device components.  \\n• Piracy.  \\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud \\nservices such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for \\nvolume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue \\noften reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of \\nPCs sold in a given year.  \\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, \\nincluding mobile devices and cloud offerings.  \\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating \\nsystems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.  ',\n",

Growth in Devices is \\ndependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new \\ncategories.  \\nGaming  \\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, \\ncommunity, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first -party \\nstudios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to \\nexpand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of \\nXbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first - and \\nthird-party console and PC titles.  \\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage \\nboth on - and off -console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued \\ninvestment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on -\\ndemand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorite games with \\nthem and play on the device most convenient to them.   \\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows -\\nenabled devices, and other devices.  Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified \\napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer \\nbase. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first - and third -party content, as well as advertising. \\nGrowth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability \\nof games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used \\nto access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first -party content creators.  \\nSearch and News Advertising  \\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a \\nglobal audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and \\nmonetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with \\nrelevant content and advertiser offerings.  \\nOn June  6, 2022, we acquired Xandr, Inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital \\nadvertising solutions.  \\nCompetition  \\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple \\nand Google.

We believe our gaming platform is \\neffectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant \\ninnovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and \\ncontinued strong exclusive content from our own first -party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.  \\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like \\nMeta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.  \\nOPERATIONS  \\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, \\ncredit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland \\nsupports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater \\nChina, and Asia -Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, \\nWashington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also \\noperate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.  \\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international \\nmarkets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require \\nmodifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.  \\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third -party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have \\nthe ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. \\nHowever, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these \\ncomponents, we have limited near -term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is \\nunable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar \\ndisruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  \\nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property  \\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.  \\n• Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and \\nefficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development \\ntools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and \\nservices for enterprises.  \\n• Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end -user experiences and \\ndevices, including Office, Windows, Teams, consumer web experiences (including search and news \\nadvertising), and the Surface line of devices.  \\n• Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management , focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity \\nand network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.    \\n• Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward -looking research and \\ndevelopment efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.  \\n• LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.  ',\n",
              " '26   \\n• Gaming,  focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help \\ngrow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.  \\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer \\ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and \\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as \\npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before \\nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application \\nvendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product \\ndocumentation internally.  \\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to \\nensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and \\nhardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing \\npatents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending \\nworldwide. While we employ much of our internally -developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and \\nservices, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ \\nproducts. From time to time, we enter into broader cross -license agreements with other technology companies covering \\nentire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. \\nAt times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as \\npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting \\nand enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause \\nus to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.  \\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, \\nand business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be \\nobtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not \\nmaterially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our \\nproducts.  \\nInvesting in the Future  \\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to \\ninitiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad \\nadoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we \\nbelieve offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our \\nassessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long -term commitment to research and development across a wide \\nspectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, \\nand operating systems.  \\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate \\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain \\ncompetitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.  \\nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and \\nas appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results \\nacross the Company.  \\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is \\none of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around \\nthe world to advance the state -of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique \\nperspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation.

              " '27   \\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING  \\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and \\nresellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and \\npublic -sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; \\nmanaging OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who \\nengage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.  \\nOEMs  \\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre -install our software on new devices and servers they sell. \\nThe largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre -installed on devices. OEMs also sell \\ndevices pre -installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to \\nsubscribe to Office 365.  \\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs.  The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is \\nmanaged through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or \\nmore of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett -Packard, Lenovo, and with many \\nregional and local OEMs.  The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower -volume PC \\nmanufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre -installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft \\ndistributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.  \\nDirect  \\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and \\nEnterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, \\nand partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” \\nor “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to \\nthose offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.  \\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and \\ngaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical \\nlocations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper \\nengagement with our partners and customers across industries.  \\nDistributors and Resellers  \\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), \\ndistributors, value -added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations \\nof all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically \\nreach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other \\nvolume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.  \\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non -exclusive distributors, authorized \\nreplicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We \\ndistribute our devices through third -party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support \\npersonnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.  \\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing \\nvertical solutions and specialized services.  ',\n",
              " '28   \\nLICENSING OPTIONS  \\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on -premises software, and SA. We license \\nsoftware to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of \\nproducts and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs \\ndesigned to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the \\nworld, generally they include those discussed below.  \\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides \\nsupport, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included \\nwith certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.  \\nVolume Licensing Programs  \\nEnterprise Agreement  \\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to \\nbuy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large \\norganizations that want to license cloud services and on -premises software organization -wide over a three -year period. \\nOrganizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.  \\nMicrosoft Customer Agreement  \\nA Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital \\nexperience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non -expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over \\ntime, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.  \\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement  \\nA Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, \\nactivate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to \\nacquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud -based services.  \\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreement  \\nMicrosoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud \\nservices and on -premises software as needed, with no organization -wide commitment, under a single, non -expiring \\nagreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that \\npurchase perpetual licenses.  \\nOpen Value  \\nOpen Value agreements are a simple, cost -effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements \\nare designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on -premises software over a \\nthree -year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to \\nlicenses and SA is included.  \\nSelect Plus  \\nA Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on -premises licenses at any \\naffiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses \\nand SA is optional.  ',\n",
              " '29   \\nPartner Programs  \\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in \\ncombination with the value -added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud \\nreseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, \\nmanage, and support their customer subscriptions.  \\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors \\nwho want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end \\ncustomers. Partners license software over a three -year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.  \\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other \\napplications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.  \\nCUSTOMERS  \\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public -sector \\ninstitutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs.  Our practice is to ship our products promptly \\nupon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.  \\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION  \\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com. At our Investor Relations website, www.microsoft.com/investor, we make \\navailable free of charge a variety of information for investors. Our goal is to maintain the Investor Relations website as a \\nportal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us, including:  \\n• Our annual report on Form 10 -K, quarterly reports on Form 10 -Q, current reports on Form 8 -K, and any \\namendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with \\nor furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) at www.sec.gov.  \\n• Information on our business strategies, financial results, and metrics for investors.  \\n• Announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our \\nproduct, service, and competitive strategies.

We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms \\nand tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public -sector efficiency. They also \\nsupport new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.  \\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud -based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and \\nsupporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online \\nadvertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, \\nmanufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud -based services; \\nand income taxes.  \\nHighlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:  \\n• Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2  billion.  \\n• Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial \\ngrowth of 18%.  \\n• Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer \\nsubscribers grew to 59.7  million.  \\n• LinkedIn revenue increased 34%.  \\n• Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%.  \\n• Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth \\nof 45%.  \\n• Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 11%.  \\n• Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%.  \\n• Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%.  \\n• Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%.  \\n• Surface revenue increased 3%.  \\nOn March  4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc.

              " '31   \\nIndustry Trends  \\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each \\nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \\nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research \\nand development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry \\ntrends, and competitive forces.  \\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  \\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud -based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud -based services for consumers and \\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in \\nthe cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud -based services to use. We must continue to evolve \\nand adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure \\nand devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  \\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \\nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \\nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, \\nand competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to \\nglobal macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  \\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third -party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components \\nfor which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near -term flexibility to use other \\nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at \\nthese suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to \\nmeet consumer demand.  \\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \\nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \\nsignificantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not hav e \\na material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.  \\nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10 -K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  \\nSeasonality  \\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second \\nquarter revenue is driven by corporate year -end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by \\nconsumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi -year on -premises contracts executed during the \\nperiod.  \\nReportable Segments  \\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent \\nCloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with \\nour internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment \\nInformation and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10 -K.  \\nMetrics  \\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of \\nresources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into \\nperformance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business \\nmetrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and  ',\n",

The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10 -K. \\nFinancial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last \\nfiscal year.  \\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, \\nmost notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server \\nproducts and cloud services metrics and changes to align with how we manage our Windows OEM and Search and news \\nadvertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&A.  \\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance.

The decrease in our effective tax \\nrate was primarily due to a $3.3  billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer \\nof intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and \\nforeign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in \\nthe case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement \\nbetween the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) \\nregulations.  \\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the  \\nU.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3  billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year \\n2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low -taxed \\nincome tax.  \\nWe have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit \\nassessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, \\nsome dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a \\nparty to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we \\nrecorded a net income tax benefit of $620  million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India \\nSupreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.  \\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to  \\nthe transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and \\ndistributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating t o \\nstock -based compensation.  ',\n",
              " '38   \\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result \\nof the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. \\nincome before income taxes was $47.8  billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9  billion. In fiscal year \\n2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0  billion and our foreign income before income taxes was \\n$36.1  billion.  \\nUncertain Tax Positions  \\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In \\nFebruary 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 \\nand reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in \\nfiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of \\nfiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of \\n$1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  \\nAs of June  30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a \\nmaterial impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for \\nincome tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer \\npricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.  Based on the information \\ncurrently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within  \\nthe next 12 months.  \\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject \\nto examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution \\nof each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  \\nNON -GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non -GAAP financial measures which exclude the net  tax benefit \\nrelated to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit rela ted \\nto an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Equity investments were $6.9  billion and $6.0  billion as of June  30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our \\nshort -term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of \\nhighly liquid investment -grade fixed -income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The \\ninvestments are predominantly U.S. dollar -denominated securities, but also include foreign currency -denominated \\nsecurities to diversify risk. Our fixed -income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk \\nand average maturity of our fixed -income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain \\nfixed -income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short -term \\ninvestments held are primarily highly liquid investment -grade fixed -income securities.  \\nValuation  \\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the  \\nfair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level  1 investments, such as U.S. \\ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical \\nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  or \\ninputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to ou r \\nLevel  2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, \\nmortgage - and asset -backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level  3 investments are \\nvalued using internally -developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  \\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level  1 or Level  2 investments as these \\nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without \\napplying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not \\npriced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment  \\ntrades. Our broker -priced investments are generally classified as Level  2 investments because the broker prices these \\ninvestments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker -priced \\ninvestments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these \\ninvestments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. \\nThese controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period -over-period fluctuations, and \\nindependent recalculation of prices where appropriate.  \\nCash Flows  \\nCash from operations increased $12.3  billion to $89.0  billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash \\nreceived from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing \\nincreased $10.4  billion to $58.9  billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3  billion increase in common stock \\nrepurchases and a $5.3  billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7  billion to \\n$30.3  billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1  billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of \\ncash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3  billion increase in additions to property and \\nequipment, offset in part by a $15.6  billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest -free installments over eight years, with 8% \\ndue in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.

Preparing \\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of \\noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment \\nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  \\nRevenue Recognition  \\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for \\nseparately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud -based service includes both on -premises \\nsoftware licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered \\ndistinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized \\nover time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and \\ninterrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance \\nobligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \\nJudgment is required to determine the stand -alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We use \\na single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on -premises licenses sold with SA or \\nsoftware updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the \\nproducts and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative \\nSSP of the various products and services.  \\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \\nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \\ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.  \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \\nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \\nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \\ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \\nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \\nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \\nImpairment of Investment Securities  \\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, \\nwe evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to \\nwhich the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this  ',\n",
              " '43 judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in \\nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the \\nfinancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not \\nthat we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an \\nimpairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, \\nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  \\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \\nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \\nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \\namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in \\nother income (expense), net.  \\nGoodwill  \\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \\nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \\napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that \\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or \\ncircumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, \\ncompetition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  \\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of  \\nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of \\neach reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \\nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent \\non internal forecasts, estimation of the long -term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which \\ncash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  \\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \\nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the \\ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  \\nResearch and Development Costs  \\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \\ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs  \\nare capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \\ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \\nproducts is reached after all high -risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \\noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of \\nrevenue over the estimated life of the products.  \\nLegal and Other Contingencies       \\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \\nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an \\nasset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In \\ndetermining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an \\nunfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could \\nmaterially impact our consolidated financial statements.  ',\n",
              " '44   \\nIncome Taxes  \\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current \\nyear, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an \\nentity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more \\nlikely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical \\nmerits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on \\nthe largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature \\nalso provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets \\nand liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is  \\nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial \\nstatements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our \\nconsolidated financial statements.  \\nInventories  \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor,  \\nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \\nselling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \\nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include \\nanalysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, \\nand component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a \\nnew cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \\nCHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE  \\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \\nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \\nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying \\namount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June  30, 2022, it is estimated this \\nchange will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $3.7  billion. We had previously increased the estimated \\nuseful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.  \\n  ',\n",

The recast of these prior \\nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated \\ncash flows statements.  \\nPrinciples of Consolidation  \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.  \\nEstimates and Assumptions  \\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue \\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone \\nselling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and \\nrefunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible \\nassets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubt ful \\naccounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock -based compensation forfeiture rates; when \\ntechnological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been \\nrecognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments \\nfor investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and \\nuncertainties.  \\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \\nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \\nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously \\nincreased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.  \\nForeign Currencies  \\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. \\nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments \\nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  \\nRevenue  \\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  \\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross -device productivity applications, server applications, \\nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and \\nhardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  ',\n",
              " '53   \\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud -based solutions that provide customers with software, services, \\nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. \\nService and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.  \\nRevenue Recognition  \\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects \\nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can \\ninclude various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as \\nseparate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from \\ncustomers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  \\nNature of Products and Services  \\nLicenses for on -premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available \\nto the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the \\nsame functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from \\ndistinct on -premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the \\ncustomer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no \\nadditional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of \\nthe related device or license.  \\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on -premises licenses combined with \\nSoftware Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and \\nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On -premises licenses \\nare considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized \\nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises \\ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.  \\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \\nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \\nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \\nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of \\nsuch resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the \\nindividual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services \\nare provided.  \\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action \\nnecessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are \\nprovided.  \\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot \\nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single \\nperformance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or \\ndirectly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  \\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant \\nproduct and service offering.  \\nSignificant Judgments  \\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be  ',\n",
              " '54 accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud -based service includes both on -\\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and \\nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, \\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together \\nas one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services \\nare provided.  \\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \\nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on -premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at \\nno additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services \\nseparately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various \\nproducts and services.  \\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \\nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \\ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.  \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \\nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \\nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \\ndetermining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \\nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \\nconsideration were not material for the periods presented.  \\nContract Balances and Other Receivables  \\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue \\nis recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi -year \\nagreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a \\nreceivable related to revenue recognized for multi -year on -premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice \\nand receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  \\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and \\ncloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi -year \\nagreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting \\nservices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows \\npost-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn \\nthe revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  \\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in \\nunearned revenue during the period.  \\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 \\nto 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \\nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \\nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing \\nfrom our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription \\nterm with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi -year on -premises licenses that are invoiced \\nannually with revenue recognized upfront.

              " '55   \\nAs of June  30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0  billion and $965  million, respectively, and \\nare included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.  \\nAs of June  30, 2022 and 2021, long -term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8  billion and \\n$3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable \\nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \\navailable evidence.  \\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  \\n  \\n(In millions)          \\n        \\nYear Ended June  30, 2022  2021  2020  \\n        \\nBalance, beginning of period  $    798  $    816  $   434  \\nCharged to costs and other   157   234   560  \\nWrite -offs  (245 )  (252)  (178 )       \\nBalance, end of period  $ 710  $ 798  $ 816          \\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:  \\n  \\n(In millions)          \\nJune  30, 2022  2021  2020  \\n        \\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts  $    633  $    751  $    788  \\nOther long -term assets   77   47   28        \\nTotal  $ 710  $ 798  $  816          \\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and \\nservices offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June  30, 2022 and 2021, our \\nfinancing receivables, net were $4.1  billion and $4.4  billion, respectively, for short -term and long -term financing \\nreceivables, which are included in other current assets and other long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We \\nrecord an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \\navailable evidence.  \\nAssets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer  \\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \\ncosts to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \\ncapitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in \\nother current and long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the \\namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation \\nprogram and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate \\nwith annual sales activities.  \\nCost of Revenue  \\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs \\nrelated to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold \\nby original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online  ',\n",
              " '56 advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and \\nroyalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and \\nthe amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over \\nthe estimated lives of the products.  \\nProduct Warranty  \\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the \\nrelated revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product \\nfailure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific \\nhardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, \\nbut generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90  days to three years. For software warranties, \\nwe estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly \\nreevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as \\nnecessary.  \\nResearch and Development  \\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock -based compensation expense, and other \\nheadcount -related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include \\nthird-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, \\nand the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are \\nincluded in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our \\nsoftware products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is \\nreached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  \\nSales and Marketing  \\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock -based compensation expense, and other \\nheadcount -related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, \\ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was \\n$1.5 billion, $1.5  billion, and $1.6  billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  \\nStock -Based Compensation  \\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), \\nis measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related \\nservice or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the \\ngrant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value \\nof PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight -line method \\nand for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.  \\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is \\nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  \\nIncome Taxes  \\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. \\nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of \\nsuch temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation \\nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified a s \\nlong-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  ',\n",
              " '57   \\nFinancial Instruments  \\nInvestments  \\nWe consider all highly liquid interest -earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to \\nbe cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with \\noriginal maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short -term \\ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short -term based on their highly liquid \\nnature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \\nDebt investments are classified as available -for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \\nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other \\ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates \\ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general \\nmarket conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To \\ndetermine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative \\nevidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, \\nthe investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securi ty \\nbefore recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), \\nnet and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we \\nmay incur future impairments.  \\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \\ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \\nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \\nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less \\nthan carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  \\nDerivatives  \\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for \\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), \\nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded \\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of \\nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged \\nitem. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in \\nother income (expense), net.  \\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily \\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.  \\nFair Value Measurements  \\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on th e \\nextent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  We categorize each of our fair value \\nmeasurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement \\nin its entirety. These levels are:  \\n• Level  1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \\nLevel  1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.  Our \\nLevel  1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.  ',\n",
              " '58   \\n• Level  2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model -based valuation techniques (e.g. the \\nBlack -Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by \\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these \\nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market -based \\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot \\nprices for currencies. Our Level  2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency \\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage - and asset -backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, \\nand municipal securities. Our Level  2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over -the-counter forward, \\noption, and swap contracts.  \\n• Level  3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that \\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using \\nmodel -based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level  3 \\nassets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill \\nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.  Unobservable \\ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  \\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these \\ninvestments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted \\nmarket prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  \\nInventories  \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor,  \\nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \\nselling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \\nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a \\nreduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \\nProperty and Equipment  \\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight -line method \\nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and \\nequipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; \\ncomputer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to \\n20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.  \\nLeases  \\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right -of-use \\n(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases  \\nare included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long -term liabilities in our consolidated balance \\nsheets.  \\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation \\nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at \\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not \\nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for \\ncollateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU \\nasset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to \\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease \\npayments is recognized on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  ',\n",
              " '59   \\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non -lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For \\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non -lease components as a single lease \\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the \\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.  \\nGoodwill  \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) \\non an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more \\nlikely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  \\nIntangible Assets  \\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight -line method over their estimated \\nperiod of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking \\ninto account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be \\nimpaired.  \\nRecent Accounting Guidance  \\nAccounting for Income Taxes  \\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for \\nincome taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the \\nmethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside \\nbasis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance \\nalso simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the \\naccounting for transactions that result in a step -up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard effective July  1, \\n2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  \\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE  \\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock \\noutstanding during the period.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include \\nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our \\nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  \\nForeign Currencies  \\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign \\ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  \\nForeign currency risks related to certain non -U.S. dollar -denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange \\nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro -\\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging \\ninstruments.  \\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign \\nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  \\nInterest Rate  \\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed -rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value \\nhedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.  ',\n",
              " '64 Securities held in our fixed -income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We \\nmanage the average maturity of our fixed -income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad -\\nbased fixed -income indices using exchange -traded option and futures contracts and over -the-counter swap and option \\ncontracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables \\nbelow.  \\nEquity  \\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.  At times, we may hold options, futures, \\nand swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in \\nthe tables below.  \\nCredit  \\nOur fixed -income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment -grade securities. We use credit default swap \\ncontracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad -based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These \\ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.  \\nCredit -Risk -Related Contingent Features  \\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and \\noutstanding long -term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum \\nliquidity of $1.0  billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to \\nthe standard convention related to over -the-counter derivatives. As of June  30, 2022, our long -term unsecured debt rating \\nwas AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0  billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.  \\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar \\nequivalents:  \\n  \\n(In millions)  June  30, \\n2022  June  30, \\n2021    \\n      \\nDesignated as Hedging Instruments      \\n      \\nForeign exchange contracts purchased  $ 635  $ 635  \\nForeign exchange contracts sold   0   6,081   \\nInterest rate contracts purchased   1,139    1,247   \\n      \\nNot Designated as Hedging Instruments      \\n      \\nForeign exchange contracts purchased     10,322      14,223   \\nForeign exchange contracts sold   21,606    23,391   \\nOther contracts purchased   2,773    2,456   \\nOther contracts sold   544   763    \\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments  \\nThe following table presents our derivative instruments:  \\n  \\n(In millions)  Derivative  \\nAssets  Derivative  \\nLiabilities  Derivative  \\nAssets  Derivative  \\nLiabilities    \\n      \\n  June  30, \\n2022  June  30, \\n2021  \\n          \\nDesignated as Hedging Instruments          \\n          \\nForeign exchange contracts  $  0  $(77) $ 76  $   (8) ',\n",

In 2019, the SAMR \\npresented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti -Monopoly Law.  \\nProduct -Related Litigation  \\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation  \\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a \\ndefendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaint iffs \\nwho allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We \\nassumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have \\nbeen substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre -trial \\nproceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of \\nColumbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. \\nFederal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre -empted by federal \\nlaw. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the \\nFCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry -wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and \\ntesting around emission guidelines.  \\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \\nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ \\nmotion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of \\nColumbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court \\nof Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial \\ncourt for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which \\nthe defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ \\nexpert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for September of 2022.  \\nOther Contingencies  \\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our \\nbusiness. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not \\nhave a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent \\nuncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.  \\nAs of June  30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $364  million. While we intend to defend these matters \\nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600  million in aggregate beyond recorded \\namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \\nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the \\nfollowing segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.  \\nOur reportable segments are described below.  \\nProductivity and Business Processes  \\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, \\ncommunication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:  \\n• Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial \\nsubscriptions, and Office licensed on -premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, \\nOffice 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva.  \\n• Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on -premises, and other \\nOffice services.  \\n• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.  \\n• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud -based \\napplications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on -premises ERP \\nand CRM applications.  \\nIntelligent Cloud  \\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can \\npower modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:  \\n• Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, \\nVisual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.  \\n• Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance \\nprofessional services.  \\nMore Personal Computing  \\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the \\nexperience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:  \\n• Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non -volume licensing of the Windows operating \\nsystem; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows \\ncloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.  \\n• Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.  \\n• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first - and third -party content \\n(including games and in -game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, \\nthird-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.  \\n• Search and news advertising.  \\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our \\nbusiness, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from \\ncertain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, \\nwhich can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit \\nmargin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that \\nare allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit \\nand are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all mat erial \\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its \\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.  \\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria \\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of \\nthe Treadway Commission and our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting.  \\nBasis for Opinion  \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities \\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those \\nrisks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made \\nby management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits \\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \\nCritical Audit Matters  \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current -period audit of the financial statements \\nthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or \\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex  \\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, \\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the \\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

              " '85   \\nRevenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements   \\nCritical Audit Matter Description  \\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount \\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company \\noffers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud -based services, \\nin its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.  \\nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, \\nand includes the following:  \\n• Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be \\naccounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud -\\nbased services.  \\n• The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.  \\n• Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., \\nvariable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).  \\n• Determination of stand -alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that \\nare not sold separately.  \\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments \\nin determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor \\njudgment.  \\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the \\nfollowing:  \\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the \\ndetermination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  \\n• We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for \\nreasonableness.  \\n• We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:  \\n- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents \\nthat were part of the agreement.  \\n- Tested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.  \\n- Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of \\ntheir accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  \\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand -alone selling prices for products and services \\nthat are not sold separately.  \\n• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue \\nrecognized in the financial statements.

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS \\naudit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the \\nremaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.  \\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management \\njudgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior -\\nyear audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain \\nunresolved with the IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions \\nrequired extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.  \\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management’s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved \\ntransfer pricing issues included the following:  \\n• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in the \\nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the \\neffectiveness of the related internal controls.  \\n• We read and evaluated management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information \\nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.  \\n• We tested the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax \\npositions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.  \\n• For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had \\nappropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure \\nof the uncertain tax positions.  \\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, \\nregulations and case law, impacted management’s judgments.  \\n/S/    DELOITTE  & TOUCHE  LLP  \\nSeattle, Washington  \\nJuly 28, 2022  \\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1983.  \\n  ',\n",

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive \\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  \\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  \\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the \\nCompany. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\nour financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \\nStates of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail \\naccurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary \\nfor preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of \\ncompany assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that \\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated \\nfinancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control \\nover financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial \\nstatements would be prevented or detected.  \\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the \\nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting was effective as of June  30, 2022. There were no changes in our internal control over financial \\nreporting during the quarter ended June  30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially \\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial \\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating \\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered \\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  \\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  \\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements.  \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,  \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.  \\n  \\n/S/ DELOITTE  & TOUCHE  LLP   \\n    \\nSeattle, Washington    \\nJuly 28, 2022    ',\n",

Some of it will travel well\\nto other regions and countries, some probably will not. Caveat\\nemptor.\\nWith all that out of the way, let’s start at the beginning: why not\\nto do a startup.\\nStartups, even in the wake of the crash of 2000, have become\\nimbued with a real mystique — you read a lot about how great\\nit is to do a startup, how much fun it is, what with the getting to\\ninvent the future, all the free meals, foosball tables, and all the\\nrest.\\nNow, it is true that there are a lot of great things about doing a\\nstartup. They include, in my experience:\\nMost fundamentally, the opportunity to be in control of your own\\ndestiny — you get to succeed or fail on your own, and you don’t\\nhave some bozo telling you what to do. For a certain kind of personality, this alone is reason enough to do a startup.\\nThe opportunity to create something new — the proverbial blank\\nsheet of paper.

Is the\\ntechnologist really all that? Is the business person capable of\\nrunning the company? Is the business person missing from the\\nteam altogether? Is it a business person or business people with\\nno technologist, and therefore virtually unfundable?\\nMarket risk — is there a market for the product (using the term\\nproduct and service interchangeably)? Will anyone want it? Will\\nthey pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?\\n12 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nCompetition risk — are there too many other startups already\\ndoing this? Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the\\nother startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incumbents?\\nTiming risk — is it too early? Is it too late?\\nFinancing risk — aaer we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of Xnancing will be required for the company to\\nbecome proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain\\nare we about these estimates? How do we know?\\nMarketing risk — will this startup be able to cut through the\\nnoise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition — the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate — work?\\nDistribution risk — does this startup need certain distribution\\npartners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For\\nexample, this is a common problem with mobile startups that\\nneed deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)\\nTechnology risk — can the product be built? Does it involve rocket\\nscience — or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural\\nlanguage processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that\\nneed to happen?

If you’re the technologist on a\\nfounding team with a business person, you have to consider the\\npossibility that the VCs don’t think the business person is strong\\nenough to be the founding CEO. Or vice versa, maybe they\\nthink the technologist isn’t strong enough to build the product.\\nYou may have to swap out one or more founders, and/or add\\none or more founders.\\nI put this one right up front because it can be a huge issue and\\nthe odds of someone being honest with you about it in the speciXc are not that high.\\nMarket risk — you probably need to validate the market, at a\\npractical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market\\nresearch will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually\\nneed to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market\\nexists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible\\nprospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.\\nCompetition risk — is your diWerentiation really sharp enough?\\n14 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nRethink this one from the ground up. Lots of startups do not\\nhave strong enough diWerentiation out of the gate, even aaer\\nthey get funded. If you don’t have a really solid idea as to how\\nyou’re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known\\nand unknown competitors, you might not want to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nTwo additional points on competition risk that founders routinely screw up in VC pitches:\\nNever, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals\\nnaivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really\\nhave no competition, you must not be in a great market. Even\\nif you really believe you have no competitors, create a competitive landscape slide with adjacent companies in related market\\nsegments and be ready to talk crisply about how you are like and\\nunlike those adjacent companies.\\nAnd never, ever say your market projections indicate you’re\\ngoing to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your\\n(extremely large) market. That also signals naivete. If you’re\\ngoing aaer 2% of a large market, that means the presumably\\nlarger companies that are going to take the other 98% are going\\nto kill you. You have to have a theory for how you’re going to get\\na signiXcantly higher market share than 2%. (I pick 2% because\\nthat’s the cliche, but if you’re a VC, you’ve probably heard someone use it.)\\nTiming risk — the only thing to do here is to make more\\nprogress, and demonstrate that you’re not too early or too late.'),\n",

What if you have a startup for which you’d like to\\nraise venture funding, but you don’t know any VCs?\\nI can certainly sympathize with this problem — when I was in\\ncollege working on Mosaic at the University of Illinois, the term\\n“venture capital” might as well have been “klaatu barada nikto”\\nfor all I knew. I had never met a venture capitalist, no venture\\ncapitalist had ever talked to me, and I wouldn’t have recognized\\none if I’d stumbled over his checkbook on the sidewalk. Without\\nJim Clark, I’m not at all certain I would have been able to raise\\nmoney to start a company like Netscape, had it even occured to\\nme to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nThe starting point for raising money from VCs when you don’t\\nknow any VCs is to realize that VCs work mostly through referrals — they hear about a promising startup or entrepreneur\\nfrom someone they have worked with before, like another\\nentrepreneur, an executive or engineer at one of the startups\\nthey have funded, or an angel investor with whom they have\\npreviously co-invested.\\nThe reason for this is simply the math: any individual VC can\\nonly fund a few companies per year, and for every one she\\nfunds, she probably meets with 15 or 20, and there are hundreds\\nmore that would like to meet with her that she doesn’t possibly\\nhave time to meet with. She has to rely on her network to help\\nher screen the hundreds down to 15 or 20, so she can spend her\\ntime Xnding the right one out of the 15 or 20.\\nTherefore, submitting a business plan “over the transom”, or\\nunsolicited, to a venture Xrm is likely to amount to just as much\\nas submitting a screenplay “over the transom” to a Hollywood\\ntalent agency — that is, precisely nothing.\\nSo the primary trick becomes getting yourself into a position\\nwhere you’re one of the 15 or 20 a particular venture capitalist\\nis meeting with based on referrals from her network, not one of\\nthe hundreds of people who don’t come recommended by anyone and whom she has no intention of meeting.\\nBut before you think about doing that, the Xrst order of business\\nis to (paraphrasing for a family audience) “have your stuG\\ntogether” — create and develop your plan, your presentation,\\nand your supporting materials so that when you do meet with a\\nVC, you impress her right out of the gate as bringing her a fundable startup founded by someone who knows what he — that’s\\nyou — is doing.\\nMy recommendation is to read up on all the things you should\\ndo to put together a really eWective business plan and presentation, and then pretend you have already been turned down once\\n— then go back to my last post and go through all the diWerent\\nthings you should anticipate and Xx before you actually do walk\\nthrough the door.\\nOne of the reason VCs only meet with startups through their\\nnetworks is because too many of the hundreds of other startups\\nthat they could meet with come across as amateurish and uninformed, and therefore not fundable, when they do take meetings with them. So you have a big opportunity to cut through\\nthe noise by making a great Hrst impression — which requires\\nreally thinking things through ahead of time and doing all the\\nhard work up front to really make your pitch and plan a masterpiece.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 19\\nWorking backwards from that, the best thing you can walk in\\nwith is a working product.

So,\\nwhen such a new thing comes out — like, hint hint, Facebook or\\nTwitter — jump all over it, see which VCs are using it, and interact with them that way — sensibly, of course.\\nMore generally, it’s a good idea for entrepreneurs who are\\nlooking for funding to blog — about their startup, about interesting things going on, about their point of view.

Or, more bluntly, what causes\\nsuccess? And, for those of us who are students of startup failure\\n— what’s most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a\\npoor market?\\nLet’s start by deXning terms.\\nThe caliber of a startup team can be deXned as the suitability of\\nthe CEO, senior staW, engineers, and other key staW relative to\\nthe opportunity in front of them.\\nYou look at a startup and ask, will this team be able to optimally\\nexecute against their opportunity? I focus on eWectiveness as\\nopposed to experience, since the history of the tech industry is\\nfull of highly successful startups that were staWed primarily by\\npeople who had never “done it before”.\\nThe quality of a startup’s product can be deXned as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses\\nit: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How\\nfast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or\\nrather, how few) bugs does it have?\\nThe size of a startup’s market is the the number, and growth\\nrate, of those customers or users for that product.\\n(Let’s assume for this discussion that you can make money at\\nscale — that the cost of acquiring a customer isn’t higher than\\nthe revenue that customer will generate.)\\nSome people have been objecting to my classiXcation as follows:\\n“How great can a product be if nobody wants it?” In other words,\\nisn’t the quality of a product deXned by how appealing it is to\\nlots of customers?\\nNo. Product quality and market size are completely diWerent.\\nHere’s the classic scenario: the world’s best soaware application\\nfor an operating system nobody runs.

This is a topic that could Xll a\\nwhole book, but in this post I will provide speciXc guidelines on\\nhow to hire, manage, promote, and Xre executives in a startup\\nbased on my personal observations and experiences.\\nFor the purposes of this post, deXnitions: An executive is\\na leader — someone who runs a function within the company\\nand has primary responsibility for an organization within the\\ncompany that will contribute to the company’s success or failure. The diWerence between an executive and a manager is that\\nthe executive has a higher degree of latitude to organize, make\\ndecisions, and execute within her function than a manager.

              " Document(page_content='decisions, and execute within her function than a manager. The\\nmanager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should\\nknow.\\nThe general theory of executives, like managers, is, per Andy\\nGrove: the output of an executive is the output of her organization.\\nTherefore, the primary task of an executive is to maximize the\\noutput of her organization. However, in a startup, a successful\\nexecutive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:\\n• Build her organization– typically when an executive arrives\\nor is promoted into her role at a startup, she isn’t there to be\\na caretaker; rather she must build her organization, oaen\\nfrom scratch. This is a sharp diWerence from many big\\ncompany executives, who can spend their entire careers\\nrunning organizations other people built — oaen years or\\ndecades earlier.\\n• Be a primary individual contributor– a startup executive\\nmust “roll up her sleeves” and produce output herself. There\\nare no shortage of critical things to be done at a startup, and\\nan executive who cannot personally produce while\\nsimultaneously building and running her organization\\ntypically will not last long. Again, this is a sharp diWerence\\nfrom many big companies, where executives oaen serve\\nmore as administrators and bureaucrats.\\n• Be a team player– a startup executive must take personal\\nresponsibility for her relationships with her peers and people\\nthroughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels. Big\\ncompanies can oaen tolerate internal rivalries and warfare;\\nstartups cannot.\\nBeing a startup executive is not an easy job. The rewards are\\nsubstantial — the ability to contribute directly to the startups’s\\nsuccess; the latitude to build and run an organization according\\nto her own theories and principles; and a meaningful equity\\nstake that can lead to personal Xnancial independence if the\\nstartup succeeds — but the responsibilities are demanding and\\nintense.\\nHiring\\nFirst, if you’re not sure whether you need an executive for a function,\\ndon’t hire one.\\nStartups, particularly well-funded startups, oaen hire executives\\ntoo early. Particularly before a startup has achieved product/\\nmarket Xt, it is oMen better to have a highly motivated manager or\\ndirector running a function than an executive.\\nHiring an executive too quickly can lead to someone who is\\nreally expensive, sitting there in the middle of the room, doing\\nvery little. Not good for the executive, not good for the rest of\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 55\\nthe team, not good for the burn rate, and not good for the company.\\nHire an executive only when it’s clear that you need one: when an\\norganization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate;\\nwhen you need more processes and structure and rigor to how\\nyou do things.\\nSecond, hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next\\nthree years.\\nI’ve seen a lot of startups overshoot on their executive hires.\\nThey need someone to build the soaware development team\\nfrom four people to 30 people over the next nine months, so\\nthey hire an executive from a big company who has been running 400 people. That is usually death.\\nHire for what you need now — and for roughly the next nine\\nmonths. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and\\nthe person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for\\nyears to come.\\nIn contrast, if you overhire — if you hear yourself saying, “this\\nperson will be great when we get bigger” — you are most likely\\nhiring someone who, best case, isn’t that interested in doing\\nthings at the scale you need, and worst case, doesn’t know how.\\nThird, whenever possible, promote from within.\\nGreat companies develop their own executives. There are several reasons for this:\\n• You get to develop your best people and turn them into\\nexecutives, which is great for both them and you — this is the\\nsingle best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great\\npeople for long periods of time.\\n• You ensure that your executives completely know and'),\n",
              " Document(page_content='single best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great\\npeople for long periods of time.\\n• You ensure that your executives completely know and\\nunderstand your company culture, strategy, and ethics.\\n• Your existing people are the “devil you know” — anyone new\\ncoming from outside is going to have Yaws, oaen really\\nserious ones, but you probably won’t Xgure out what they are\\n56 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nuntil aaer you’ve hired them. With your existing people, you\\nknow, and you minimize your odds of being shocked and\\nappalled.\\nOf course, this isn’t always possible. Which segues us directly\\ninto…\\nFourth, my list of the key things to look at, and for, when evaluating executive candidates:\\n• Look for someone who is hungry and driven– someone who\\nwants a shot at doing “their thing”. Someone who has been an\\nup and comer at a midsized company but wants a shot at\\nbeing a primary executive at a startup can be a great catch.\\n• Flip side of that: beware people who have “done it\\nbefore”.Sometimes you do run into someone who has been VP\\nEngineering at four companies and loves it and wants to do it\\nat a Xah company. More oaen, you will be dealing with\\nsomeone who is no longer hungry and driven. This is a very,\\nvery big problem to end up with — be very careful.\\n• Don’t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness– as long as\\nshe’s not insane. Great executives are high-ego — you want\\nsomeone driven to run things, driven to make decisions,\\nconXdent in herself and her abilities. I don’t mean loud and\\nobnoxious, I mean assured and determined, bleeding over\\ninto cocky. If a VC’s ideal investment is a company that will\\nsuccceed without him, then your ideal executive hire is someone who\\nwill succeed without you.\\n• Beware hiring a big company executive for a startup.The\\nexecutive skill sets required for a big company vs a startup\\nare very Even great big company executives frequently\\nhave no idea what to do once they arrive at a startup.\\n• In particular, really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly\\nsuccessful big company. This is oaen very tempting — who\\nwouldn’t want to bring onboard someone who sprinkles\\nsome of that IBM (in the 80’s), Microsoa (in the 90’s), or\\nGoogle (today) fairy dust on your startup? The issue is that\\npeople who have been at an incredibly successful big\\ncompany oaen cannot function in a normal, real world,\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 57\\ncompetitive situation where they don’t start every day with\\n80% market share. Back in the 80’s, you oaen heard, “never\\nhire anyone straight out of IBM — Xrst, let them go\\nsomewhere else and fail, and then hire them”. Believe it.\\n• This probably goes without saying, but look for a pattern of\\noutput– accomplishment. Validate it by reference checking\\npeers, reports, and bosses. Along the way, reference check\\npersonality and teamwork, but look Xrst and foremost for a\\npattern of output.\\nFiah, by all means, use an executive recruiter, but for sourcing, not\\nevaluation.\\nThere are some executive recruiters who are actually really\\ngood at evaluation. Others are not. It’s beside the point. It’s your\\njob to evaluate and make the decision, not the recruiter’s.\\nI say this because I have never met a recruiter who lacks conXdence in his ability to evaluate candidates and pass judgment on\\nwho’s right for a given situation. This can lull a startup founder\\ninto relying on the recruiter’s judgment instead of really digging\\nin and making your own decision. Betting that your recruiter is\\ngreat at evaluation is not a risk you want to take. You’re the one\\nwho has to Xre the executive if it doesn’t work out.\\nSixth, be ready to pay market compensation, including more cash\\ncompensation than you want, but watch for red Gags in the compensation discussion.\\nYou want someone focused on upside — on building a company. That means, a focus on their stock option package Xrst\\nand foremost.\\nWatch out for candidates who want egregious amounts of cash,'),\n",

Don’t let it happen to you — make sure the person you\\nhire into that role is way better than you used to be.\\nEighth, recognize that hiring an executive is a high-risk proposition.\\nYou oaen see a startup with a screwed up development process,\\nbut “when we get our VP of Engineering onboard, everything\\nwill get Xxed”. Or a startup that is missing its revenue targets, but\\n“when we get our VP of sales, reveue will take oW”.\\nHere’s the problem: in my experience, if you know what you’re\\ndoing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 59\\n50/50. That is, about 50% of the time you’ll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person. (If you don’t know what\\nyou’re doing, your failure rate will be closer to 100%.)\\nWhy? People are people. People are complicated. People have\\nYaws. You oaen don’t know what those Yaws are until aaer you\\nget to know them. Those Yaws are oaen fatal in an executive\\nrole.

While respecting someone’s experience and\\nskills, you should nevertheless manage every executive as if she\\nwere a normal employee. This means weekly 1:1’s, performance\\nreviews, written objectives, career development plans, the whole\\nnine yards. Skimp on this and it is very easy for both your relationship with her and her eWectiveness in the company to skew\\nsideways.\\nThis even holds if you’re 22 and she’s 40, or 50, or 60!

Manage her, understand what she is doing, be\\nvery clear on the results you expect, but let her do the job.\\nHere’s the key corollary to that: if you want to give an executive full\\nlatitude, but you’re reluctant to do so because you’re not sure she can\\nmake it happen, then it’s probably time to Fre her.\\nIn my experience it’s not that uncommon for a founder or CEO\\nto be uncomfortable — sometimes only at a gut level — at really\\ngiving an executive the latitude to run with the ball. That is a\\nsureXre signal that the executive is not working out and probably needs to be Xred. More on that below.\\nThird, ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data.\\nI don’t mean going around telling people under an executive\\nwhat to do without her knowing about it. I mean, ask questions,\\ncontinually, at all levels of the organization. How are things\\ngoing? What do you think of the new hires? How oaen are you\\nmeeting with your manager? And so on.\\nYou never want the bulk of your information about a function\\ncoming from the executive running that function. That’s the\\nbest way to be completely and utterly surprised when everything blows up.\\nHere’s the kicker: a great executive never minds when the CEO talks\\nto people in her organization. In fact, she loves it, because it means\\nthe CEO just hears more great things about her.\\nIf you have an executive who doesn’t want you to talk to people\\nin her organization, you have a bad executive.\\nPromoting\\nThis will be controversial, but I am a big fan of promoting talented\\npeople as fast as you can — promoting up and comers into executive roles, and promoting executives into bigger and broader\\nresponsibilities.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 61\\nYou can clearly overdo this — you can promote someone before\\nthey are ready and in the worst case, completely screw up their\\ncareer. (Seen it. Done it.) You can also promote someone to their\\nlevel of incompetence — the Peter Principle. (Seen it. Done it.)\\nHowever, life is short, startups move fast, and you have stuE to get\\ndone. You aren’t going to have the privilege of working with\\nthat many great, talented, high-potential people in your career.\\nWhen you Xnd one, promote her as fast as you can. Great for\\nher, great for the company, and great for you.\\nThis assumes you are properly training and managing her along the\\nway.

Projects are getting done,\\nteam morale is good, new hires are top quality, people are\\nhappy. Time to promote some people into new challenges.\\nI’m a Xrm believer that most people who do great things are doing\\nthem for the Frst time. Returning to my theory of hiring, I’d rather\\nhave someone all Xred up to do something for the Xrst time\\nthan someone who’s done it before and isn’t that excited to do it\\nagain. You rarely go wrong giving someone who is high potential the shot.\\nThis assumes you can tell the high potential people apart from everyone\\nelse. That too is lea as an exercise for the reader.\\nFiring\\nFirst, recognize the paradox of deciding to Fre an executive.\\nThe paradox works like this:\\nIt takes time to gather data to evaluate an executive’s performance.

It takes time for her to build\\nand manage her organization to generate output. Therefore, it'),\n",

Therefore, it\\n62 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ntakes longer to evaluate the performance of an executive than a normal\\nemployee.\\nBut, an executive can cause far more damage than a normal\\nemployee. A normal employee doesn’t work out, Xne, replace\\nhim. An executive doesn’t work out, it can — worst case — permanently cripple her function and sometimes the entire company. Therefore, it is far more important to Fre a bad executive as fast\\nas possible, versus a normal employee.\\nSolution? There isn’t one. It’s a permanent problem.\\nI once asked Andy Grove, one of the world’s all-time best CEOs,\\nabout this. He said, you always Xre a bad executive too late. If\\nyou’re really good, you’ll Xre her about three months too late.\\nBut you’ll always do it too late. If you did it fast enough that it\\nwasn’t too late, you wouldn’t have enough data, and you’d risk\\nbeing viewed as arbitrary and capricious by the rest of the organization.\\nSecond, the minute you have a bad feeling in your gut, start gathering\\ndata.\\nBack to the point on ruthlessly violating the chain of command\\n— get to it. Talk to everyone. Know what’s going on. Unless\\nyou’re paranoid — and, shockingly, I have met paranoid\\nfounders and CEOs, and not counting Andy Grove — you need\\nto gather the data because you’re going to need to Xre the executive — if you’re good, in about three months.\\nIn the meantime, of course do everything you can to coach and\\ndevelop and improve the executive. If it works out, that’s great.\\nIf not, get ready.\\nA few speciXc things I think are critical to look for:\\n• Is the executive hiring?If there are open headcount slots and\\nnobody’s coming in the door, you have a problem. Just as bad\\nis when the new hires aren’t very good — when they’re\\nbringing down the average quality of the organization.\\n• Is the executive training and developing her people?Oaen in a\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 63\\nstartup, an executive is hired to take over a function that’s\\nalready been started, at least in rudimentary form. The\\npeople in that function should be noticeably better at their\\njobs, and highly respectful of the executive’s skills, within the\\nXrst several months at the very least. If not, you have a\\nproblem.\\n• What do the other executives think?Great executives are oaen\\nimperfect but their peers always respect them. If your other\\nexecutives are skeptical of a new executive aaer the Xrst few\\nmonths, you have a problem.\\n• Is it painful for you to interact with the executive?Do you try to\\navoid or cancel your 1:1’s? Does talking to her give you a\\nheadache? Do you oaen not understand what point she’s\\ntrying to make or why she’s focused on such an odd issue? If\\nthe answer to any of these questions is yes, you have a\\nproblem.\\nThird, Fre crisply.\\nFiring an executive sucks. It’s disruptive to the organization. It\\ncreates a lot of work for you — not least of which is you’ll have\\nto go Xnd someone else for the job. And, it risks making you\\nlook bad, since you’re the one who hired the person in the Xrst\\nplace.\\nAnd it always seems to happen at a critical time in your startup’s\\nlife, when the last thing you need is a distraction like this.\\nNevertheless, the only thing to do is do it, do it professionally,\\nmake clear to the organization what will happen next, and get\\non down the road.\\nIn my opinion the two most common mistakes people make\\nwhen they Xre executives both fall in the category of pulling\\none’s punches, and I highly recommend avoiding them:\\n• Long transition periods — tempting, but counterproductive.\\nConfusing, demoralizing, and just plain weird. Instead, make\\na clean break, put a new person in charge — even if only on\\nan acting basis — and get moving.\\n64 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n• Demotion as an alternative to Xring (or, alternately, “I know,\\nwe’ll hire her a boss!”).

I have italicized the parts where he really tears into me for your\\nadded humor value.]\\nWhile I enjoyed Marc’s post on hiring and Xring executives, I\\nthink that he unfairly dissed micromanagement.\\nHere’s why.\\nEveryone knows that the hyper-controlling manager with the\\nsevere personality disorder who micromanages every crummy\\ndecision is no fun to work for. However, it is wrong to condemn\\nthe practice of micromanagement on that basis.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 65\\nSpeciXcally, there are times and situations where micromanaging executives is not just ok, but also the right thing to do.\\nAndy Grove has an excellent explanation of this in his classic\\nbook High Output Management, where he describes a concept\\ncalled “Task Relevant Maturity”. Andy explains that employees\\nwho are immature in a given task require detailed training and\\ninstruction. They need to be micromanaged. On the other\\nhand, if an employee is relatively mature in a task, then it is\\ncounterproductive and annoying to manage the details of their\\nwork.\\nThis is also true when managing executives. Marc might think\\nthat he hires an executive because she has the experience and\\nknow-how to comprehensively do her job, so any detailed\\ninstruction would be unwise and unwarranted. Marc would be\\nwrong about that. It turns out that even — and maybe especially\\n— executives are also immature in certain tasks.\\nIt is almost always the case that a new executive will be immature in their understanding of your market, your technology,\\nand your company — its personnel, processes, and culture. Will\\nthe new head of engineering at Ning walk in the door with\\nMarc’s understanding of the development process or the technology base? Would it be better for this new head of engineering\\nto make guesses and use her own best — not so good– judgment, or for Marc to review the Xrst say 20 decisions until the\\nnew exec is fully up to speed?\\nIn reality — as opposed to Marc’s warped view of reality — it will\\nbe extremely helpful for Marc [if he were actually the CEO,\\nwhich he is not] to meet with the new head of engineering daily\\nwhen she comes on board and review all of her thinking and\\ndecisions. This level of micromanagement will accelerate her\\ntraining and improve her long-term eWectiveness. It will make\\nher seem smarter to the rest of the organization which will build\\ncredibility and conXdence while she comes up to speed. Micromanaging new executives is generally a good idea for a limited\\nperiod of time.\\nHowever, that is not the only time that it makes sense to micro66 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nmanage executives.

Everybody has severe weaknesses even if you can’t see\\nthem yet. When managing, it’s oaen useful to micromanage and\\nto provide remedial training around these weaknesses. Doing so\\nmay make the diWerence between an executive succeeding or\\nfailing.\\nFor example, you might have a brilliant engineering executive\\nwho generates excellent team loyalty, has terriXc product judgment and makes the trains run on time.

The reason is that she very likely has no idea how to be\\neWective with her peers. If somebody is an executive, it’s very\\nlikely that somewhere along the line somebody gave her feedback — perhaps abstractly — about all of her weaknesses. Yet\\nthe weakness remains. As a result, executives generally require\\nmore hands-on management than lower level employees to\\nimprove weak areas.\\nSo, micromanagement is like Xne wine.

This post isn’t really about retention at all.\\nIt’s about winning.\\nLet me explain:\\nCompanies that are winning — even really big, old ones — never\\nhave a retention problem. Everyone wants to stay, and when someone does leave, it’s really easy to get someone great to take her\\nplace.\\nCompanies that have a retention problem usually have a winning problem. Or rather, a “not winning” problem.\\nThe typical case is a company that used to be a hot growth company, but the growth has Yattened out, causing the stock to tank\\nand everyone to be in a bad mood. Or, alternately, an older\\nbig company that did really well for a while but more recently\\nhasn’t been doing so well, causing the stock to tank and everyone to be in a bad mood.\\nIn other words, a company in transition — from winning at one\\npoint, to not winning now.\\nThe only way a company in that situation can retain great people is to start winning again.\\nGreat people want to work at a winner.\\nAll the raises, perks, and HR-sponsored “company values” draaing sessions in the world won’t help you retain great people if\\nyou’re not winning — not even the $6,000 heated Japanese toilets in all the restrooms, the $30,000 Olympic lap pool out back,\\nand the free $4 bottles of organic orange juice in all the snack\\nrooms.\\nThis seems deeply unfair when you’re going through it, because\\nwhen you’re not winning, that’s exactly when you need all those\\ngreat people the most!\\nOh well. That’s the price we pay for living in a society where\\njobs aren’t for life anymore.\\nSo the right question is, how can we start\\nwinning again?\\nIn this post, I’m going to punt on large parts of the answer to\\nthat question, as follows:\\n• I already discussed the big company turnaround scenarioin\\nmy last post in this series, which describes how to take a big\\ncompany that is no longer winning and set it up to win again.\\n• A company that was a hot startup a few years ago and grew\\nfast but is now seeing growth slow has a slightly diWerent\\nproblem — your original product cycle has peaked and you\\nneed to Xnd a new product cycle. That’s your big challenge,\\nway beyond retention. But I’ll talk about that in a future post.\\nRetention follows from the steps you are taking to orchestrate\\nthe turnaround and/or get to the next big product cycle.\\nHaving adroitly sidestepped most of what you need to do, let\\nme now address some things you can do to help the retention\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 87'),\n",

I am particularly talking about the former hot\\nstartup that is now a large slow-growth company. It is easy to\\nsay, well, we’re not a startup anymore, we’re not a growth company anymore — now we’re a big company, and we need to\\nchange our culture and our methods to attract and retain the\\nkinds of people who like to work at big companies.\\nDoing that will make your situation far worse, by causing the\\nremaining great people you do have to abandon ship even\\nfaster. Who wants to work for a company that has given up on\\nhaving energy and drive and ambition? And then you will end\\nup with a staW that only knows how to be a big company —\\nthat only knows how to maintain something that someone else\\nhas already built — which is death in any industry where things\\nchange all the time.\\nSecond, focus. In a technology company, focus on retaining the\\ngreat architects and managers. In other kinds of companies,\\nfocus on retaining the equivalent people — the people who are\\nthe magnets for retaining other great people and hiring more\\ngreat people.\\nYou have to retain the magnets — or at least a critical mass of\\nthem — because without them, you’re going to lose everyone\\nelse.\\nIf you bear down and focus on retaining the magnets, retaining\\neveryone else — for example, in a soaware company, the junior\\nprogrammers, the product managers, the user interface designers, the salespeople, the sales engineers, the marketing staW, and\\nso on — will be much easier.\\nThird, clean house. Any company with a retention problem probably also has an overstaZng problem and a mediocrity problem\\nand needs to Xx both of those at the same time.\\nIdentify and eliminate the jobs of the following categories of\\npeople:\\n88 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n• People who are “vesting in peace” — so called “VIPs”. VIPs are\\na particular problem at the former hot startup that has\\nplateaued. They suck the life out of their environment and\\nhave to go.\\n• “Summertime soldiers” — people who only joined in the Xrst\\nplace because you were already successful and have no\\ninterest in really bearing down and applying themselves to a\\nchallenge. Again, a classic problem for the former hot\\nstartup. Look particularly hard at the people who joined in\\nthe two years following the IPO — some of them are\\nundoubtedly very hard working, but others are summertime\\nsoldiers and have to go.\\n• Mediocre performers — every company has some, unless\\nyou have been routinely Xring your bottom 10% every year,\\nand even then you probably have some.\\nTaking out the people who fall into these categories will make\\nyour remaining great people feel better immediately, and will\\nsave you a lot of money and stock options that you can reallocate to better purposes — such as new compensation packages\\nfor your remaining great people.\\nFourth, promote your best people — especially into the jobs vacated\\nby the more senior of the people you just Xred — and give them\\nvery interesting challenges.\\nThat is so fundamental that I’m not even going to discuss it further here.\\nFiMh, simplify and clarify your organizational structure to make sure\\nthat your best people have direct responsibility for their projects.\\nCompanies coming oW a period of signiXcant success usually\\nhave grown a lot and/or bought a lot of other companies, and\\ntypically have messy or overly complex org structures. This is a\\ngreat opportunity to clean that up — and in particular, to move\\nto an organizational model where each of your stars has clear,\\ndirect, and comprehensive responsibility for a critical mission.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 89\\nNuke all matrices.

              " Document(page_content='Nuke all matrices. Nuke all dual reporting structures. And nuke\\nas many shared services functions as you possibly can.\\nFor example, in a soaware company, break up the centralized\\ndocumentation group, QA group, build group, etc. and disperse\\nthose people into the individual product divisions. Give your\\nproduct division heads complete responsibility for everything\\nthey need to ship great products — except for sales. And then in\\nsales, give your territory heads everything they need to kill their\\nnumbers.\\nA great general rule of thumb for this kind of organizational\\nredesign is that you want to tolerate overlap. So each product\\ndivision has its own QA team — so what? Your division heads —\\nwho are now your best people — will be able to move so much\\nfaster that way that it’s worth it. Plus, you saved so much money\\ntaking out the VIPs, summertime soldiers, and mediocre people\\nthat you’re still ahead on headcount expense.\\nRemember, it’s generally a good idea, once you do all of this\\nrestructuring, to end up with smaller team sizes than you had\\nbefore. By reducing the size of a team, and increasing the average quality level within the team, you will usually speed things\\nup, while saving money.\\nFinally, be sure to take out layers — especially at the top of the\\ncompany. The best people who are now running all the key projects and divisions should be no more than one layer away from\\nthe CEO, and usually that means you can take out at least one\\nlayer, maybe two, and (shudder) maybe even more.\\nSixth, put the recruiters to work, aggressively — but don’t rely on them\\nfor everything.\\nNotably, for the really critical open jobs, go out and recruit the\\nright person yourself, or better yet promote from within.\\nAnd here’s a neat trick that actually works. Go out and re-recruit\\nthe best people who already lea. Some of them have since\\ndiscovered that the grass isn’t actually greener at whatever\\nmediocre startup they joined or whatever other big company\\n90 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthey jumped to. Give them fat packages against the new mission\\nand get them back.\\nSeventh, ramp up college recruiting. This will be very important for\\nyou over the next couple years. College recruiting is the best\\nway to get a bunch of new Xred up people into your company\\nwho are hungry and who don’t realize quite how badly you suck.\\n(That was a joke.)\\nEighth, communicate within — tell everyone in your company\\nclearly and unambiguously, we are here to win and here’s how\\nwe’re going to do it. It won’t be easy, but we can do it and we will do\\nit, and we will have amazing stories to tell our grandchildren.\\nYou don’t need to be certain of all the answers! Colin Powell\\nsays, “You know you’re a good leader when people follow you, if\\nonly out of curiosity.” So project boldness, and have that glint in\\nyour eye where people know you’re up to something big.\\nNinth, shake things up. Directly on Powell’s curiosity point —\\nchange the story to something new. Overhaul the organization,\\nmove people around, Xre people, promote other people, cancel\\nproducts, double down on other products, do some acquisitions,\\ncut some big deals, do some spinoWs, whatever — but change\\nthe story. Reintroduce curiosity.\\nWhen all else fails, do a “shake and bake” — do a big transformative deal that you’re not sure will work but which you think\\nhas a real shot. That will at the very least inject energy back into\\nthe situation.\\nI am being deliberately cavalier about this tactic, especially the\\n“shake and bake” part. You can easily destroy your company\\nwith this kind of move.\\nBut — and this is a very important but — a company in crisis\\noaen has a severe narrative or “story” problem that accompanies its business problems, and it can be hard to get people\\ninside and outside the company motivated to reengage without\\nyou forcing a dramatic change to the story in some fundamental\\nway.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 91\\nStories don’t change by themselves.

Most people who\\nsay they want career planning advice aren’t actually looking for\\nadvice — they just want validation of the path they have already\\nchosen. Because of that, giving someone career planning advice\\nis one of the surest ways to end up feeling like an a******.\\nHowever, as with so many other things, career planning is a\\ntopic about which I have plenty of opinions. And since I started\\nthis blog, I’ve received a lot of questions from people who are\\nlooking for career planning advice. So, this series of posts will\\npresent my opinions on career planning in today’s world.\\nDisclaimers:\\n• These posts are aimed at high-potential people who want to\\nexcel throughout their careers and make a signiXcant impact\\non their Xelds and the world. These posts are not appropriate\\nfor people for whom work/life balance is a high priority or\\nfor whom lifestyle is particularly important — if that’s you,\\nthere are plenty of existing career planning resources for you\\nalready!\\n• My background is biased towards high-tech companies and\\nSilicon Valley, and my advice will be most relevant to people\\nentering either my industry or other industries that are like\\nmy industry — fast moving, rapidly changing, and\\ncharacterized by lots of new companies and lots of\\nopportunity for new people. Some of this advice may be\\napplicable to people entering other kinds of Xelds — but I\\nwouldn’t know and I won’t guarantee it.\\n• I’ll use a lot of words like “ambition” and “promotion” and\\n“gaining more responsibility”. It may seem like I’m talking\\nabout moving up through the management ranks and\\nmanaging more and more people, but my intention is for all\\nof this advice to be equally relevant to people in purely\\ntechnical careers, such as soaware programming. If you\\naren’t interesting in managing people, then when I talk about\\npromotion and advancement, just think about getting\\nbroader latitude to work on or lead more complex technical\\nprojects, assuming more technical seniority within a\\ncompany, and the like.\\n• Everything that follows is purely personal opinion —\\nspeciXcally, these are the things I would want to know if I\\nwere entering college today. I’m sure there are many equally\\nvalid counterpoints to each of my points, and I look forward\\nto reading them on other people’s blogs!\\n98 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 1: Opportunity\\nThe Hrst rule of career planning: Do not plan your career.\\nThe world is an incredibly complex place and everything is'),\n",

You can’t plan your career because you have\\nno idea what’s going to happen in the future. You have no idea what\\nindustries you’ll enter, what companies you’ll work for, what\\nroles you’ll have, where you’ll live, or what you will ultimately\\ncontribute to the world. You’ll change, industries will change,\\nthe world will change, and you can’t possibly predict any of it.\\nTrying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only\\nserve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really signiXcant\\nopportunities that life will throw your way.\\nCareer planning = career limiting.\\nThe sooner you come to grips with that, the better.\\nThe second rule of career planning: Instead of planning your\\ncareer, focus on developing skills and pursuing opportunities.\\nI’ll talk a lot about skills development in the next post. But for\\nthe rest of this post, I’m going to focus in on the nature of opportunities.\\nOpportunities are key. I would argue that opportunities fall loosely\\ninto two buckets: those that present themselves to you, and\\nthose that you go out and create. Both will be hugely important\\nto your career.\\nOpportunities that present themselves to you are the consequence — at least partially — of being in the right place at the\\nright time. They tend to present themselves when you’re not\\nexpecting it — and oaen when you are engaged in other activities\\nthat would seem to preclude you from pursuing them. And\\nthey come and go quickly — if you don’t jump all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.\\nI believe a huge part of what people would like to refer to as\\n“career planning” is being continuously alert to opportunities\\nthat present themselves to you spontaneously, when you happen to be in the right place at the right time.\\n• A senior person at your Xrm is looking for someone young\\nand hungry to do the legwork on an important project, in\\naddition to your day job.\\n• Your former manager has jumped ship to a hot growth\\ncompany and calls you three months later and says, come\\njoin me.\\n• Or, a small group of your smartest friends are headed to\\nDenny’s at 11PM to discuss an idea for a startup — would you\\nlike to come along?\\nI am continually amazed at the number of people who are presented with an opportunity like one of the above, and pass.\\nThere’s your basic dividing line between the people who shoot up in\\ntheir careers like a rocket ship, and those who don’t — right there.\\nThe second bucket of opportunities are those you seek out and\\ncreate. A lot of what will follow in future posts in this series\\nwill discuss how to do that. However, let me say up front that I\\nam also continually amazed at the number of people who coast\\nthrough life and don’t go and seek out opportunities even when\\nthey know in their gut what they’d really like to do. Don’t be one\\nof those people. Life is way too short.\\nThe world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want,\\nand you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion,\\n100 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthe world will oaen reconXgure itself around you much more\\nquickly and easily than you would think.\\nNow, I’m not proposing that you simply ping pong from\\nopportunity to opportunity randomly. You can have a strategy.\\nAnd here’s how I think that strategy should work.\\nPeople who manage money professionally don’t think about\\nindividual investments in isolation; they think of those investments as part of an overall portfolio. Each investment has its\\npotential return — the beneXt you get from owning it — and its\\npotential risks — the things that can go wrong.

Or, investments that are far less risky and have far\\nless return potential than one would normally want — to protect one’s downside. The risk of any individual investment is not\\nimportant; what is important is how the risks — and the potential returns — of all of the investments combine in the overall\\nportfolio.\\nI believe you should look at your career as a portfolio of jobs/\\nroles/opportunities. Each job that you take, each role that you\\nchoose to Xll, each opportunity you pursue, will have a certain\\npotential return — the beneXts you can get from taking it,\\nwhether those beneXts come in the form of income, skill development, experience, geographic location, or something else.\\nEach job will also have a certain risk proXle — the things that\\ncould go wrong, from getting Xred for not being able to handle\\nthe job’s demands, to having to move somewhere you don’t\\nwant to, to the company going bankrupt, to the opportunity cost\\nof not pursuing some other attractive opportunity.\\nOnce you start thinking this way, you can think strategically\\nabout your career over its likely 50+ year timespan.\\nFor example, when you are just out of school and have a low\\nPart 1: Opportunity 101\\nburn rate and geographic Yexibility, you can take jobs with a\\ncertain return/risk proXle. If you get married and have kids, you\\nwill take jobs with a diWerent return/risk proXle. Later, when\\nyour kids grow up and you are once again free to move about\\nand you don’t have to worry about tuition payments and a\\nmortgage on a big house in a great school district, but you now\\nhave far more experience than you did when you were Xrst\\nstarting out, you can take jobs with a third return/risk proXle.\\nMost people do not think this way. They might occasionally\\nthink this way, but they don’t do it systematically. So when\\nan opportunity pops up, they evaluate it on a standalone basis\\n— “boy, it looks risky, I’m not sure I should do it”. What you\\nshould automatically do instead is put it in context with all of\\nthe other risks you are likely to take throughout your entire\\ncareer and decide whether this new opportunity Fts strategically into\\nyour portfolio.\\nLet’s dig into the concept of risk a little more.\\nI’m not talking about the form of risk that you think of when\\nyou think of stepping out into the crosswalk and getting run\\nover by an Escalade. I’m talking about the form of risk that\\nXnancial professionals deal with (see the classic book Against\\nthe Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk for more on this), and\\nstartup entrepreneurs deal with, and that you deal with any time\\nyou make any decision. There are a set of potential downsides to\\nalmost any decision — but they can be analyzed, and oMen quantiFed,\\nand thereby brought under control.\\nWhich is important, because in life, there is generally no opportunity\\nwithout risk. Doing the legwork on that extra project for the\\nsenior person at your Xrm? You risk exhausting yourself and\\ndoing your day job poorly. Joining your former manager at\\nthat hot growth company? Maybe it tanks six months later and\\nthen your current employer won’t rehire you. Join those smart\\nfriends at Denny’s and start a new company with them?

This is not\\nthe time in your career to play it safe.\\n• When you have family obligations — a spouse, two and a half\\nkids, a dog, and a picket fence — that’s obviously the time to\\ncrank back on the income risk and instead take a little risk\\nthat you might not learn as much or advance as quickly or\\njoin that hot new startup. However, even this is not black and\\nwhite! In Silicon Valley, for example, it can still make a lot of\\nsense for a young parent to take a risk on a hot new startup\\nbecause it will usually be easy to get another job if the startup\\nfails — especially if one has developed more useful skills and\\nexperiences along the way.\\n• There may be times when you realize that you are\\ndissatisXed with your Xeld — you are working in enterprise\\nsoaware, for example, but you’d really rather be working on\\ngreen tech or in a consumer Internet company. Jumping\\nfrom one Xeld into another is always risky because your\\nspeciXc skills and contacts are in your old Xeld, so you’ll have\\nless certainty of success in the new Xeld. This is almost always a\\nrisk worth taking– standing pat and being unhappy about it\\nhas risks of its own, particularly to your happiness. And it is\\nawfully hard to be highly successful in a job or Xeld in which\\none is unhappy.\\n• Likewise with geography risk. You start out in one city — say,\\nworking at a soaware company in Philadelphia — and you’re\\ndoing well. You get the opportunity to jump to a faster\\ngrowing soaware company in Silicon Valley. Should you take\\nthe risk of moving geographies — to a place where you don’t\\nknow anybody, and where the cost of living is higher?

Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any\\nother, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one\\nskill…\\nAt least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal.\\nThe great thing about communication is that most people are\\nterrible at it, because they never take it seriously as a skill to\\ndevelop.\\nThis is particularly true of engineers and technical people, who\\noaen quaintly believe that the world works logically and that\\npeople will automatically recognize the quality of things.\\nHa!\\nOf course, communication is critically important because it’s\\nhow you convey information and concepts to lots of people in\\nways that will cause them to change their behavior.\\nThis is one good argument for certain liberal arts undergrad\\ndegrees, such as English. But you don’t need speciXc college\\ntraining to be a good communicator — you can learn communication many other ways, including by doing, by practicing, by\\ntaking classes (how about a class in standup comedy? I’m serious!), and by reading a lot. And communication in combination\\nwith some other useful skill is much more powerful than communication alone.\\nAn engineer or a Xnance person or a lawyer who can communicate is hugely more valuable than one who cannot.\\nAnd in the long run, you are going to have a very hard time ever\\nchanging the world if you can’t communicate really well.\\nSecond, management.\\nIf at all possible, learn how to manage people.\\nPart 2: Skills and education 113\\nThe best way is to learn from a great manager.\\nEarly in your career, make sure you are working for a great\\nmanager — you’ll know her when you see her in action — and\\nthen ask her to teach you how to do it.\\nAnd then give it a shot — ask for and get responsibility for a\\nteam of people whom you manage.\\nEven if your career path won’t involve managing lots of people,\\nbeing able to manage will give you a highly valuable tool that\\nyou can pull out whenever you need it, instead of forcing you to\\nalways be reliant on other people to manage.\\nWorst case, you’ll understand a lot more about why companies\\nwork the way they do and why people are the way they are.\\nWhich is hugely helpful when you set about doing something\\nnew.\\nThird, sales.\\nLearn how to sell.\\nI don’t mean, learn how to sell someone a set of steak knives\\nthey don’t need — although I hear that can be quite an education by itself.\\nI mean, learn how to convince people that something is in their\\nbest interest to do, even when they don’t realize it up front.\\nThink of this as the art of being able to interact with people\\nsuch that they will do what you want, predictably and repeatedly, as long as you are making sense and oWering them something they should want.\\nThis is another terribly underrated skill, at least among people\\nwho aren’t professional salespeople. But it’s an incredibly general skill that can be helpful not only in your career but\\nthroughout your entire life.

It is probably still young and vital, and there are\\nprobably still opportunities to exploit all over the place, either\\nat those companies or at new companies in that industry.\\nIf not — if the industry’s founders are dead, or old and out of\\ntouch — beware. That industry is now dominated by companies\\nthat are being run by second or third or even fourth generation managers who inherited their companies pre-built, and are\\nserving as caretakers.\\nIf you are young and want to have an impact, you want to be in\\nan industry where there is a lot of growth and change and Iux\\nand opportunity.\\nAs an industry ages, the vitality drains out until all that’s lea is a\\nset of ossiXed remnants in the form of oligopolostic entities of\\nwhich you would Xnd being a part to be completely soul-killing.\\nThe exception comes when an industry has gotten so old and\\nossiXed that the clear opportunity exists to up-end it and introduce a new order, a new way of doing things, and therefore a\\nnew set of companies.\\nIn some industries this happens routinely — e.g. every 10-20\\nyears.

Tasks that seem most urgent and important are\\non top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower\\ndown on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing\\nthe things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate\\ntask structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen.\\nIndeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.”\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 131\\nReading John’s essay was one of the single most profound\\nmoments of my entire life.\\nFor example, I hate making phone calls.

Or maybe can only do it partially. And many people enjoy living a highly structured life and\\nobviously this approach is not for them.\\nBut if your reaction is, “boy, I wish I could do that”, then it may\\nwell be worth rethinking your approach to your career.\\nI can tell you from personal experience that being stuck in a role\\nwhere you have a lot of structure but feel like you never get any138 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthing done is not the optimal way to advance in one’s profession,\\nor maximize one’s job satisfaction.\\nSecond, I do not recommend pursuing this approach in one’s\\npersonal life :-).\\nOn another topic, the tactic of each night, write down the 3 to\\n5 things you need to do the next day has struck some people as\\ntoo simplistic.\\nThat may be the case for some people, but I can’t tell you how\\nmany times I’ve arrived home at night and am at a loss as to\\nwhat I actually got done that day, despite the fact that I worked\\nall day.\\nAnd I also can’t tell you how oaen I’ve had a huge, highly-structured todo list in front of me with 100 things on it and I stare\\nat it and am paralyzed into inaction (or, more likely, structured\\nprocrastination).\\nSo a day when I get 3 to 5 concrete, actionable things done in\\naddition to all the other stuW one has to do to get through the\\nday — well, that’s a good day.\\nA few people have said, why not just use GTD (David Allen’s\\n“Getting Things Done” approach).\\nWhile I Xnd GTD to be highly inspiring, in practice I think it’s\\nawfully complex.

In each case I will start with relevant excerpts of\\nMr. Munger’s speech, and then aaer that add my own thoughts.\\nOne: Reward and Punishment\\nSuperresponse Tendency\\nI place this tendency Xrst in my discussion because almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives are in changing cognition and behavior. But this is not\\noaen so. For instance, I think I’ve been in the top Xve percent of\\nmy age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power\\nof incentives, and yet I’ve always underestimated that power. Never\\na year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my\\nappreciation of incentive superpower.\\n…We [should] heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of\\nBen Franklin in Poor Richard’s Almanack: “If you would persuade,\\nappeal to interest and not to reason.” This maxim is a wise guide\\nto a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about\\nsomething else when you should be thinking about the power of\\nincentives…\\nOne of the most important consequences of incentive superpower\\nis what I call “incentive caused bias.” A man has an acculturated\\nnature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both\\nconsciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drias into\\nimmoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior [like a salesman who harms\\nher customers by selling them the wrong product because she gets\\npaid more for selling it, versus the right product — see, e.g., the\\nmutual fund industry].\\n…Another generalized consequence of incentive caused bias is that\\nman tends to “game” all human systems, oaen displaying great\\ningenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others.\\nAntigaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary\\npart of almost all system design.\\n…Military and naval organizations have very oaen been extreme\\nin using punishment [the inverse of reward] to change behavior,\\nprobably because they needed to cause extreme behavior. Around\\nthe time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the\\nassembly horn blew, always killed the last warrior to reach his\\nassigned place, and no one enjoyed Xghting this tribe.\\nHuman response to incentives is indeed a huge behavioral\\nmotivator, and I think Mr. Munger is right that once you think\\nyou realize how big it is, you need to assume it’s even bigger.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 143\\nThis is why stock options work so well in startups — and the\\nfewer people in a startup, the better stock options work, since\\nwhen there are only a few people in a company, it’s usually crystal clear to each person how her work will impact the value of\\nthe company.\\nThere is a wrong-headed and dangerous theory afoot that\\nrestricted stock (grants of fully in-the-money shares of stock) is\\na more appropriate motivator of employees of tech companies\\nthan stock options:\\nMr. Gates wanted Mr. BuWett’s input on whether to drop options in\\nfavor of restricted stock at Microsoa. [Gates] recalls asking: “How\\nwill employees respond to getting a lottery ticket that gives them a\\ndeXnite amount instead of one that could amount to nothing or a\\nridiculous sum?”\\nMr. BuWett’s reply, according to Mr. Gates, was: “My wife would\\nrather have a ticket for one fur coat, than a ticket that gave her two\\nor nothing.”\\nOvert sexism aside, from an incentive standpoint the result of'),\n",

And new hires will by deXnition be people who\\nare conservative and change-averse, as the people who want\\nto swing for the fences and get rewarded for creating something new will go somewhere else, where they will receive stock\\noptions — in typically greater volume than anyone will ever\\ngrant restricted stock — and have greater upside.\\nAnd sure enough, in the wake of shiaing towards restricted\\nstock and away from stock options, Microsoa’s stock has been\\nYat as a pancake. The incentive works.\\nNow, against that, it is true that stock options, particularly for\\npublic companies, have an oaen-destructive random component: they tend to increase in value in rising stock market environments and decrease in value (potentially to zero) in falling\\nstock market environments, regardless of whether value is being\\ncreated inside your particular company.\\nFor that reason, in the long run it probably makes sense for\\n144 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nsome new approach to stock-based compensation to be developed that both preserves the motivation to create as opposed\\nto preserve value, but factors out the environmental swings of\\nrising and falling stock markets. Some form of indexing against\\nmarket averages would probably do the trick. This has been\\ntried from time to time, and I expect it to be tried more in the\\nfuture, at least for public companies.\\nAs a company grows, stock options and other forms of equitybased motivation become less and less useful as an incentive\\ntool, since it becomes harder for many employees in a large\\ncompany to see how their individual behavior would have any\\neWect on the stock price of the overall corporation. So, more tactical incentives kick in, such as cash bonuses.\\nThe design of tactical incentives — e.g. bonuses — is a whole\\ntopic in and of itself, and is critically important as your company grows. The most signiXcant thing to keep in mind is that\\nhow the goals are designed really matters — as Mr. Munger says,\\npeople tend to game any system you put in place, and then they\\ntend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are\\ndoing the right thing.\\nI think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in\\nfront of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict\\ngaming of the Frst goal.\\nSo, for example, if you are incenting your recruiters on the\\nnumber of new employees recruited and hired, you need to\\nalso give them a counter-goal (and tie it to their compensation)\\nthat measures the quality of the new hires three months in.\\nOtherwise the recruiters are guaranteed to give you what\\nyou don’t want: a lot of mediocre new hires.\\nOne of the great unwritten Silicon Valley skewed incentive stories was a major datacenter vendor in the late 90’s that incented\\nits salespeople based on bookings of long-term datacenter leases,\\nwithout suZcient counter-goals tied to revenue collection or\\nthe customer’s ability to pay.

You\\ndon’t have to be involved in that many startups to Xnd one\\nwhere the entrepreneur knows she needs to make a tough decision — such as change strategy, or cancel a Yawed project — but\\ncan’t quite do it because employees won’t like it.

It’s\\nthe easiest thing in the world to orient yourself in opposition to\\nanother company in the same market, and to plan your actions\\nbased on what will cause damage to the competitor or block the\\ncompetitor from getting business.\\nIn the startup world, that oaen leads to multiple competitors\\nengaged in a shooting war in a market that’s still too small for\\nanyone to succeed.\\nI think it’s much better for a startup to focus on creating and\\n148 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ndeveloping a large market, as opposed to Xghting over a small\\nmarket.\\nSo when your startup’s competitive juices get Yowing — especially for the Xrst time — and you Xnd yourself Xxated on a\\ncompetitor, be sure to take a step back and say, is this really\\nwhat we want to be focused on right now — is the market we’re\\nboth in really large enough to warrant this? If so, sure, go for it,\\nguns blazing. But if not, stepping back and thinking about how\\nto focus instead on creating a large market might be more valuable.\\nA variant on this dynamic is letting your competitor determine\\nyour strategy by watching what he does and then making countermoves. The issue here is that it’s highly likely that neither\\none of you actually knows that much about what you are doing\\nyet — since you are in a new market, by deXnition — and while\\nyou know you don’t know that much about what you’re doing\\nyet, you only observe your competitors’s deliberate actions as\\nopposed to seeing their equivalent or greater level of internal\\nconfusion. So they seem like they know what they’re doing, and\\nso you fall into assuming they know more than you do, when\\nthey probably don’t.\\nSecond, when you are in a truly competitive situation, this bias\\ncan easily lead you to underestimate your competitor by, as Mr.\\nMunger says, “ignoring virtues in the object of dislike”.\\nHis product sucks, his salespeople aren’t as good, his venture\\ncapitalists are those morons who backed that large datacenter\\nvendor that went bankrupt — and so on.\\nNotably, this attitude can become cultural in your company\\nvery quickly.

As far as I’m aware, all we have are anecdotes.\\nHowever, a professor of psychology at University of California\\nDavis named Dean Simonton has conducted extensive research\\non age and creativity across many other Xelds, including science, literature, music, chess, Xlm, politics, and military combat.\\nDr. Simonton’s research is unparalleled — he’s spent his career\\nstudying this and related topics and his papers make for\\nabsolutely fascinating reading.\\nFor this post, I’ll be concentrating on his paper Age and Outstanding Achievement: What Do We Know Aaer a Century of\\nResearch? from 1988. I haven’t been able to Xnd a PDF of the\\npaper online but you can read a largely intact cached HTML\\nversion courtesy of Google Scholar.\\nLet’s go to the paper:\\nFor centuries, thinkers have speculated about the association\\nbetween a person’s age and exceptional accomplishment: Is there\\nan optimal age for a person to make a lasting contribution to\\nhuman culture or society? When during the life span can we expect\\nan individual to be most proliXc or inYuential?\\nYou can see why I think this is relevant.\\nHere we adopt the product-centered approach, that is, our focus\\nis on real-life achievements rather than performance on abstract…\\nmeasures. …\\n[A]chievement [takes] the form of noteworthy creativity… the goal\\nis to assess how productivity changes over the life span… [I] focus\\non individual accomplishment in such endeavors as science, philosophy, literature, music, and the visual arts. …\\n[Studies like these focus] on three core topics: (a) the age curve that\\nspeciXes how creative output varies over the course of a career, (b)\\nthe connection between productive precocity, longevity, and rate\\nof output, and (c) the relation between quantity and quality of output (i.e., between “productivity” and “creativity”).\\nDr. Simonton also discusses leadership as distinct from creative\\nproduction, but I’m ignoring the leadership part for now since\\nit’s quite diWerent.\\nOne empirical generalization appears to be fairly secure: If one\\nplots creative output as a function of age, productivity tends to rise\\nfairly rapidly to a deXnite peak and thereaaer decline gradually\\nuntil output is about half the rate at the peak.\\nThis is the centerpiece of Dr. Simonton’s overall theory across\\nmany domains. And is probably not unexpected. But here’s\\nwhere it gets really interesting:\\n[T]he location of the peak, as well as the magnitude of the postpeak\\ndecline, tends to vary depending on the domain of creative\\nachievement.\\nAt one extreme, some Xelds are characterized by relatively early\\npeaks, usually around the early 30s or even late 20s in chronological units, with somewhat steep descents thereaaer, so that the output rate becomes less than one-quarter the maximum. This ageAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 155\\nwise pattern apparently holds for such endeavors as lyric poetry,\\npure mathematics, and theoretical physics…\\nThe typical trends in other endeavors may display a leisurely rise\\nto a comparatively late peak, in the late 40s or even 50s chronologically, with a minimal if not largely absent drop-oW aaerward.

Besides handling the broad form of the age curve, this theory leads to an interpretation of why diWerent endeavors may peak\\nat distinct ages.\\nThe contrast between poetic and prose literature, for instance, can\\nbe interpreted as the immediate consequence of the assumption\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 159\\nthat the two domains demand a diWerent mix of the two factors:\\npoetry, more enthusiasm, and prose, more experience. Indeed, in\\nXelds in which expertise may be far more crucial than emotional\\nvigor, most notably in scholarship, we would anticipate little if any\\ndecline with age, and such is the case.\\nDr. Simonton, however, then goes on to explain that this theory\\ndoes not really match the data — for example, the data shows\\nthat quality of output in practically all Xelds does not decline\\nsystematically with age, which is what you’d expect from Beard’s\\ntheory.\\nThe paper then digs into possible correlations between intelligence as measured by such metrics as IQ, and creative output:\\n[E]ven if a minimal level of intelligence is requisite for achievement, beyond a threshold of around IQ 120 (the actual amount\\nvarying across Xelds), intellectual prowess becomes largely irrelevant in predicting individual diWerences in… creativity.\\nSo what have we learned in a nutshell?\\nGenerally, productivity — output — rises rapidly from the start\\nof a career to a peak and then declines gradually until retirement.\\n• This peak in productivity varies by Xeld, from the late 20s to\\nthe early 50s, for reasons that are Xeld-speciXc.\\n• Precocity, longevity, and output rate are linked. “Those who\\nare precocious also tend to display longevity, and both\\nprecocity and longevity are positively associated with high\\noutput rates per age unit.” High producers produce highly,\\nsystematically, over time.\\n• The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time.\\nThe periods of one’s career with the most hits will also have\\nthe most misses.

Sometimes you have it, sometimes\\nyou don’t. But perhaps there’s more to it than that.\\nDr. James Austin, a neurologist and philosopher (!), wrote an\\noutstanding book called Chase, Chance, and Creativity — originally in 1978, then updated in 2003.

However, one\\nmust be careful not to read any unconsciously purposeful intent\\ninto “interventions”… [which] are to be viewed as accidental,\\nunwilled, inadvertent, and unforseeable.\\nIndeed, chance plays several distinct roles when humans react creatively with one another and with their environment…\\nWe can observe chance arriving in four major forms and for four\\ndiWerent reasons.

In my\\npost on hiring great people, I talked about the value I place\\non curiosity — and speciXcally, curiosity over intelligence.\\nThis is why.

The story came out yesterday; below are the\\nnotes I prepared for my conversation with Gary.\\nIn a nutshell, Gary’s question to me was: what makes serial\\nentrepreneurs tick? Why do people like Max keep going and\\nstart new companies when they could just park it on a beach and\\nsuck down mai tais?\\nFirst, in my experience, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are all over\\nthe map when it comes to personality and motivation. Some\\nare purely mercenary — one hit and they’re out. Others just\\nlove the technology, and the business is a side eWect. Still others\\nare like Chauncey Gardiner in Being There. And some just love\\nstarting and building companies.\\nSecond, there were serial entrepreneurs in the past, but there\\nare certainly more now than ever before. There are many factors that lead to this — here are the big ones:\\n• There are simply more entrepreneurs now — due to the\\namazing surge in venture capital and the culture of startups'),\n",
              " Document(page_content='• There are simply more entrepreneurs now — due to the\\namazing surge in venture capital and the culture of startups\\nover the last 10-15 years — so you’d expect more serial\\nentrepreneurs just based on that.\\n• A lot of new companies simply develop faster these days than\\nthey did in the past. Microsoa and Oracle, for example, both\\nput in 10 years of incredibly hard work before going public\\n(both founded in ’76, IPO in ’86), and they only had a few\\nhundred employees each when they went public — and those\\nwere the two biggest soaware successes of their era. Versus\\nthese days, when many companies are founded, built, scaled\\nup, and sold (or, yes, taken public!) in a few years. The\\nprocess can happen so fast that people are freed up much\\nfaster; therefore, upon being freed up they are younger and\\ntend to have more raw energy than people who in the past\\nwould have spent 10 or 20 or 30 years building a single\\ncompany — and by the time they freed up, they maybe\\ndidn’t want to put that level of eWort into something again.\\n• Also because of the faster cycle time, when you start\\ncompany #2 you can assume that it won’t necessarily\\nconsume the next 10-20-30 years of your life… This makes it\\neasier for people to say, OK, hey, it worked once, I’ll try it\\nagain.\\n• The culture of startups in the Valley is clicking on all\\ncylinders — everything from fundraising to hiring to\\nbuilding out a management team to signing up lawyers and\\naccountants and bankers is simply easier than ever before.\\nI’m talking in a macro sense — over the last 10 years, versus\\nprior decades, even considering the early 2000′s bust. So it’s\\njust easier to start the next company that it was the past —\\nthe “pain in the ass” factor is lower.\\n• In terms of exit, there are some IPO’s, but the big thing is\\nthat M&A is a widely accepted and viable exit. Big companies\\nin and related to the Valley have actually become quite good,\\nin general, at acquiring small companies — not perfect, but\\nquite good. They do it frequently, in order to build out their\\nproduct families or grow market share. This of course\\ninspires more companies to be started and tends to compress\\nthe time cycles further.\\nThird, all that said, it is striking how many of the truly revolutionary companies are started, at least in part, by people who\\nSerial Entrepreneurs 169\\nhaven’t done it before. Google (Brin and Page), Yahoo (Yang and\\nFilo), Facebook (Zuckerberg), Apple (Jobs and Wozniak), etc.\\nWhen you see one of those really revolutionary companies and\\nthere’s some young kid with the idea, of course, they oaen are\\nlinked up with one or more seasoned, experienced people —\\nGoogle (Schmidt, Doerr, Moritz), Yahoo (Moritz, Koogle), Facebook (Thiel, Breyer), Apple (Markkula). So even there you see a\\nkind of a serial entrepreneur (or VC or executive) eWect which is\\nanother form of what you’re talking about.\\nFourth, drilling deeper into the motivations of the great serial\\nentrepreneurs I know, the dominant themes are:\\n• Desire to prove oneself — either “I can do it again — it wasn’t\\na Yuke the Xrst time”, or “I was the junior partner last time,\\nnow I’ll be the senior partner”, or “I got Xred from my last\\ncompany, I’ll show those f****** VCs”, or something like that.\\n• Desire to continue working and being productive — “I’m 26\\nor 30 or 34, I have a lot of energy, I have to keep moving, and\\nI’m certainly not going to go to work for some boring big\\ncompany or be another hack VC… obviously I need to start\\nanother company”.\\n• In love with the technology or a new idea — there’s more of\\nthis than cynical people think.\\n• A feeling that we’re in a unique time and place where it’s\\npossible for us to start, build, and be successful with multiple\\ncompanies — it’d be a shame to walk away from the\\nopportunity to continue to be a part of such a magical time\\nand place.

            "\n",
            "### 1. Using `for` Loops\n",
            "In Python, `for` loops are generally preferred for iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, dictionaries, or strings) because they are more readable:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a for loop\n",
            "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Using `while` Loops\n",
            "`while` loops are useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a while loop\n",
            "counter = 0\n",
            "while counter < 5:\n",
            "    print(counter)\n",
            "    counter += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Using `enumerate()`\n",
            "When you need both the index and the value from a list, you can use `enumerate()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of using enumerate\n",
            "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
            "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "    print(f\"Index {index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. List Comprehensions\n",
            "For simple cases where you want to create a new list from an existing one, list comprehensions can be more concise:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of list comprehension\n",
            "squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "print(squared)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Avoiding Side Effects\n",
            "When possible, aim to avoid side effects in your loops to make your code easier to understand and maintain. Instead of modifying variables or states within the loop, consider returning values or using functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Keeping It Simple\n",
            "Keep your loops as simple as possible. If a loop is getting complicated, it might be worth breaking it into smaller functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Choosing the Right Loop\n",
            "- Use `for` loops when iterating over collections.\n",
            "- Use `while` loops when you need to repeat until a condition changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conclusion\n",
            "Always prefer readability and maintainability when writing loops. Python’s clear syntax allows you to express ideas without unnecessary complexity. If you keep these principles in mind, your loops will be well-structured and effective!\n",
