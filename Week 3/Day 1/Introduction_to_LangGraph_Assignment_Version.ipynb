        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based model like GPT-3, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and conversational AI. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more accurate and informative responses compared to using a generative model alone.'"

It backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA).\\n\\n2. **Question:** What are the key innovations introduced by QLoRA to save memory without sacrificing performance?\\n   **Answer:** QLoRA introduces several innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights, (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimizers to manage memory spikes.\\n\\n3. **Question:** How does QLoRA perform compared to previous models on the Vicuna benchmark?\\n   **Answer:** QLoRA\\'s best model family, named Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU.\\n\\n4. **Question:** What datasets and model types were used in the QLoRA study?\\n   **Answer:** The QLoRA study involved finetuning more than 1,000 models and provided a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g., 33B and 65B parameter models).\\n\\n5. **Question:** What does the paper conclude about the reliability of current chatbot benchmarks?\\n   **Answer:** The paper concludes that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. It also highlights that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation.'"

The primary goal of QLoRA is to reduce the computational and memory requirements associated with fine-tuning large models, making it more accessible and feasible for a wider range of applications.\\n\\nHere are some key aspects of QLoRA:\\n\\n1. **Quantization**: This involves reducing the precision of the model's weights, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower precision formats like 8-bit integers. Quantization helps in reducing the memory footprint and computational load.\\n\\n2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**: This technique involves approximating the weight updates during fine-tuning using low-rank matrices. By doing so, it reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, further decreasing the computational requirements.\\n\\n3. **Efficiency**: By combining quantization and low-rank adaptation, QLoRA aims to make the fine-tuning process more efficient without significantly compromising the performance of the model. This is particularly useful when working with very large language models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n4. **Applications**: QLoRA can be applied to various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more. It allows researchers and practitioners to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains with limited resources.\\n\\nOverall, QLoRA is a valuable technique for making the fine-tuning of large language models more practical and accessible, enabling their use in a broader range of applications and settings.\",\n",
